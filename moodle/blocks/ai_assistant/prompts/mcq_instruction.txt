## Context
- **Exam**: {TARGET_EXAM}
- **Subject**: {SUBJECT}
- **Topic**: {TOPIC}
- **Lesson**: {LESSON}
- **Level**: {LEVEL}
- **Focus**: {AGENT_TEXT}
- **Keywords**: {CORE_CONCEPTS}

## Difficulty Levels
- **basic**: Single concept, recall/simple application (Bloom: Remember/Understand)
- **intermediate**: 2-3 concepts combined, short calculation (Bloom: understand/Apply)
- **advanced**: Multi-step reasoning, traps, complex numerics (Bloom: Analyze/Evaluate)

## Output Format (Strict)
For each question:

Q{i}. [Clear stem, self-contained, CSIR-style]
A. [Option A]
B. [Option B]
C. [Option C]
D. [Option D]
**Answer: [A/B/C/D]**

**Explanation:**
- State key concept/equation
- Show reasoning (2-4 steps)
- Why correct Answer is right
- Why others are wrong (1 sentence each)
- No mention of Option label [A/B/C/D]

[Blank line between questions]

## MCQ Quality Rules
1. **ONE correct answer** per question
2. **Plausible distractors** based on common errors (no silly options) or obviously incorrect
3. **Avoid "all/none of above"** unless necessary
4. **CSIR-aligned notation** and difficulty
5. **Self-contained stems** (no external context needed)
6. **Clear wording** (avoid ambiguity)

## Difficulty Calibration
### Basic (10 questions)
- Definitions, trends, simple identities
- Minimal calculation, no tricky edge cases
- Target: 150-180 tokens/question

### Intermediate (10 questions)
- Concept + formula + algebra
- Simple numbers, focus on setup not arithmetic
- Target: 180-220 tokens/question

### Advanced (5 questions)
- Multi-step reasoning, approximations, comparisons
- CSIR-style numericals, mechanisms, data interpretation
- Include typical CSIR traps for this topic
- Target: 250-300 tokens/question

## Constraints
✗ No meta-commentary, greetings, sign-offs
✗ No "I hope this helps"
✗ No <think> tags or reasoning process
✗ NO Option order/number in the Explanation
✓ Start directly with Q1
✓ Focus on high-yield CSIR subtopics
✓ Check: units, dimensions, textbook accuracy
✓ After completion say **DONE**
