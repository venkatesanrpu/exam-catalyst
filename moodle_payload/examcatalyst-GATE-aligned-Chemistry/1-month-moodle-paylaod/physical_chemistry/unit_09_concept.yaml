concepts:
  core:
  - name: Microcanonical ensemble
    clarifier: Ensemble of isolated systems with fixed energy, volume, and particle
      number forming the basis of entropy and temperature definitions.
  - name: Canonical ensemble
    clarifier: Ensemble of systems in thermal contact with a heat bath at fixed temperature,
      volume, and particle number.
  - name: Grand canonical ensemble
    clarifier: Ensemble of systems in contact with a reservoir of both energy and
      particles, characterized by fixed temperature, volume, and chemical potential.
  - name: Boltzmann distribution
    clarifier: Probability distribution of systems over energy levels in the canonical
      ensemble, proportional to the Boltzmann factor \(e^{-\beta E}\).
  - name: Partition function
    clarifier: Central quantity obtained by summing Boltzmann factors over all microstates,
      generating thermodynamic properties.
  - name: Thermodynamic properties from statistics
    clarifier: Calculation of internal energy, entropy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure,
      heat capacities, and chemical potential from partition functions.
  related:
  - name: Microstates and macrostates
    clarifier: Detailed configurations compatible with macroscopic observables and
      their counting.
  - name: Phase space and density of states
    clarifier: Representation of all possible states and the number of states in an
      energy interval.
  - name: Ensemble averages and ergodic hypothesis
    clarifier: Relationship between time averages and ensemble averages in equilibrium.
  - name: Statistical definition of entropy
    clarifier: Connection \(S = k_B \ln W\) linking microscopic multiplicity and macroscopic
      entropy.
  - name: Stirling approximation
    clarifier: Mathematical simplification for factorials used in state counting and
      entropy expressions.
  - name: Identical particles and indistinguishability
    clarifier: Treatment of systems of identical particles and resolution of Gibbs
      paradox.
  - name: Classical versus quantum statistics
    clarifier: Limits in which Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics apply and qualitative
      link to Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics.
