concepts:
  core:
  - name: Physisorption and Chemisorption
    clarifier: Physisorption - weak van der Waals interactions; Chemisorption - strong
      chemical bonding; differences in energy, reversibility, and surface coverage
  - name: Langmuir Isotherm
    clarifier: Monolayer adsorption model assuming uniform surface, no lateral interactions,
      and surface saturation; derivation from kinetic equilibrium
  - name: Freundlich Isotherm
    clarifier: Empirical power-law model for heterogeneous surfaces; applicable over
      limited pressure ranges; lacks theoretical justification
  - name: BET Isotherm
    clarifier: Extension of Langmuir model to multilayer adsorption; accounts for
      layer-by-layer condensation; yields surface area via monolayer capacity
  - name: Langmuir-Hinshelwood Mechanism
    clarifier: Surface catalysis model with reactant adsorption, surface reaction
      between adsorbed species, and product desorption
  - name: Surface Tension
    clarifier: Energy per unit area at liquid-gas or liquid-liquid interface; molecular
      basis and dependence on temperature and composition
  - name: Viscosity
    clarifier: Resistance to flow in fluids; molecular origins; temperature, pressure,
      and concentration dependence
  - name: Self-Assembly
    clarifier: Spontaneous organization of molecules into ordered structures (monolayers,
      bilayers, crystals) driven by intermolecular forces and entropy
  related:
  - name: Adsorption Thermodynamics
    clarifier: Gibbs adsorption isotherm, surface excess, and thermodynamic consistency
      of adsorption models
  - name: Surface Coverage and Kinetics
    clarifier: Fractional coverage; forward and reverse adsorption rate constants;
      approach to equilibrium
  - name: Heterogeneous Surfaces
    clarifier: Site heterogeneity, distribution of binding energies, and limitations
      of simple models on real surfaces
  - name: Interfacial Tensions
    clarifier: Solid-liquid, solid-gas, and liquid-liquid interfacial energies; Young's
      equation and contact angle
  - name: Surfactants and Amphiphiles
    clarifier: Molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties; critical micelle
      concentration (CMC); adsorption at interfaces

    clarifier: Disperse systems with particle size 1–1000 nm; DLVO theory, zeta potential,
      and stabilization mechanisms
  - name: Micelle Formation
    clarifier: Aggregation of surfactant molecules above CMC; spherical, cylindrical,
      and bilayer structures
