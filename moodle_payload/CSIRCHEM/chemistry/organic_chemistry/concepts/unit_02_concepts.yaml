concepts:
  core:
  - name: Configurational isomerism
    clarifier: Isomers differing in spatial arrangement of atoms that cannot be interconverted
      without breaking bonds
  - name: Conformational isomerism
    clarifier: Isomers differing in spatial arrangement due to rotation about single
      bonds
  - name: Stereogenicity
    clarifier: Property of molecular elements that give rise to stereoisomers
  - name: Stereoselectivity
    clarifier: Preferential formation of one stereoisomer over others in a chemical
      reaction
  - name: Enantioselectivity
    clarifier: Preferential formation of one enantiomer over its mirror image
  - name: Diastereoselectivity
    clarifier: Preferential formation of one diastereomer over others
  - name: Asymmetric induction
    clarifier: Creation of new stereogenic centers influenced by existing chirality
