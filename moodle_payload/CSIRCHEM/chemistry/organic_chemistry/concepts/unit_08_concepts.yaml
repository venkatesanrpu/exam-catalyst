total_core_concepts: 8
concepts:
  core:
  - name: Retrosynthesis
    clarifier: Backward planning of synthetic routes from target molecule to available
      starting materials
  - name: Disconnection
    clarifier: Mental breaking of bonds in target molecule to identify strategic bond
      formations
  - name: Synthons
    clarifier: Idealized charged fragments representing reactive intermediates in
      retrosynthetic analysis
  - name: Synthetic equivalents
    clarifier: Real reagents that correspond to idealized synthons
  - name: Linear synthesis
    clarifier: Sequential synthesis where target is assembled in stepwise manner from
      one starting material
  - name: Convergent synthesis
    clarifier: Parallel synthesis of fragments that are combined in later stages
  - name: Umpolung
    clarifier: Reversal of natural polarity of functional groups to enable unusual
      disconnections
  - name: Protecting groups
    clarifier: Temporary masking of functional groups to prevent unwanted reactions
