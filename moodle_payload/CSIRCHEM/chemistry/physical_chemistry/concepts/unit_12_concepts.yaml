concepts:
  core:
  - name: Crystal structures
    clarifier: Three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in crystalline
      solids including unit cells, lattice systems, and common crystal structures
  - name: Bragg's law
    clarifier: Fundamental law governing X-ray diffraction from crystal planes, relating
      wavelength, angle of incidence, and interplanar spacing
  - name: Point groups in crystals
    clarifier: Symmetry operations and their combinations that leave at least one
      point in space unchanged, classification of crystal symmetry
  - name: Band structure of solids
    clarifier: Energy band formation from atomic orbitals, distinction between conductors,
      semiconductors, and insulators based on band gaps
  - name: Imperfections in solids
    clarifier: Point defects, line defects, surface defects, and volume defects in
      crystalline materials and their effects on properties
