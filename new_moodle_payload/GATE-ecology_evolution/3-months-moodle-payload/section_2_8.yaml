concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Macroevolution (scope and patterns)"
      clarifier: "Evolutionary change at and above the species level, including speciation, extinction, and large-scale patterns such as radiations, convergence, and geographic diversification."
    - name: "Species concepts"
      clarifier: "Alternative criteria for delimiting species (biological, morphological, phylogenetic, ecological) and the contexts where each works or fails."
    - name: "Speciation"
      clarifier: "The origin of new species via the evolution of reproductive isolation; links microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary diversification."
    - name: "Reproductive isolation"
      clarifier: "Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers reducing gene flow; how barriers arise and strengthen through selection, drift, and incompatibilities."
    - name: "Adaptive radiation"
      clarifier: "Rapid diversification into multiple species accompanied by ecological and phenotypic divergence; often driven by ecological opportunity and key innovations."
    - name: "Convergent evolution"
      clarifier: "Independent evolution of similar traits in different lineages due to similar selective pressures; distinguishes similarity from common ancestry."
    - name: "Biogeography"
      clarifier: "Geographic distributions of organisms shaped by dispersal, vicariance, extinction, and historical climate/geology; used to infer evolutionary history."
  related:
    - name: "Allopatric speciation"
      clarifier: "Speciation via geographic isolation; divergence through drift and selection; barrier formation and secondary contact outcomes."
    - name: "Peripatric speciation"
      clarifier: "Speciation in small peripheral isolates; strong drift and founder effects can accelerate divergence."
    - name: "Parapatric speciation"
      clarifier: "Speciation with adjacent ranges and limited gene flow; divergence across environmental gradients."
    - name: "Sympatric speciation"
      clarifier: "Speciation without geographic separation; requires strong disruptive selection and assortative mating; common via polyploidy in plants."
    - name: "Hybrid zones and reinforcement"
      clarifier: "Secondary contact regions; reinforcement strengthens prezygotic isolation when hybrids have reduced fitness."
    - name: "Ecological speciation"
      clarifier: "Reproductive isolation evolves as a by-product of adaptation to different environments or niches."
    - name: "Sexual selection in speciation"
      clarifier: "Mate choice and signal divergence can drive rapid reproductive isolation."
    - name: "Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (DMI)"
      clarifier: "Postzygotic isolation via negative epistasis between diverged loci; explains hybrid sterility/inviability without requiring deleterious intermediates."
    - name: "Polyploid speciation"
      clarifier: "Instant reproductive isolation via chromosome duplication; auto- vs allopolyploidy; especially important in plants."
    - name: "Key innovations"
      clarifier: "Traits enabling exploitation of new niches and promoting radiations (context-dependent)."
    - name: "Character displacement"
      clarifier: "Trait divergence in sympatry due to competition; can contribute to ecological divergence and reproductive isolation."
    - name: "Homology vs convergence in phylogenies"
      clarifier: "Convergence creates homoplasy; affects character mapping and phylogenetic inference."
    - name: "Vicariance vs dispersal"
      clarifier: "Two major explanations for disjunctions; vicariance from geological splitting, dispersal from range expansion."
    - name: "Island biogeography link (overview)"
      clarifier: "Isolation and area influence diversification and endemism; connects geography to speciation and extinction."
