concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Lamarckism"
      clarifier: "Early evolutionary framework emphasizing use and disuse, inheritance of acquired characters, and progressive complexity; historical significance and limitations."
    - name: "Darwinism"
      clarifier: "Evolution by natural selection and common descent; key postulates, evidences used by Darwin, and how variation and selection generate adaptation."
    - name: "Modern Synthesis (Neo-Darwinism)"
      clarifier: "Integration of Mendelian genetics with natural selection; population genetics foundations explaining microevolution and links to macroevolutionary patterns."
    - name: "Comparative analysis of evolutionary theories"
      clarifier: "Point-by-point comparison of mechanisms, sources of variation, inheritance models, and explanatory power across Lamarckism, Darwinism, and Modern Synthesis."
  related:
    - name: "Mendelian genetics"
      clarifier: "Segregation and independent assortment as the particulate inheritance model missing in early Darwinism and central to the Modern Synthesis."
    - name: "Weismann barrier and germplasm theory"
      clarifier: "Conceptual refutation of inheritance of acquired characters; distinction between soma and germ line."
    - name: "Population genetics basics"
      clarifier: "Allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and evolutionary forces as synthesis tools."
    - name: "Variation and mutation"
      clarifier: "Mutation as an ultimate source of novel alleles; recombination reshuffles variation for selection to act upon."

    - name: "Speciation overview"
      clarifier: "Reproductive isolation and divergence; how microevolutionary processes can scale to macroevolutionary change."
    - name: "Evidence for evolution (historical context)"
