concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Population growth rate"
      clarifier: "Change in population size per unit time, typically summarized via per-capita growth rate and finite/intrinsic growth parameters used in exponential and logistic models."
    - name: "Density-independent regulation"
      clarifier: "Growth and survival shaped by factors whose effects do not depend on population density (e.g., weather extremes, disturbances), often producing additive mortality."
    - name: "Density-dependent regulation"
      clarifier: "Growth and survival shaped by factors whose effects intensify with density (e.g., competition, disease), creating negative feedback that can stabilize populations."
    - name: "Metapopulation"
      clarifier: "A set of spatially separated local populations in habitat patches connected by dispersal, where regional persistence depends on colonization-extinction dynamics."
    - name: "Colonization and extinction dynamics"
      clarifier: "Patch occupancy changes driven by dispersal-mediated colonization and local extinction; core to Levins-type metapopulation models."
    - name: "Patch structure"
      clarifier: "Spatial arrangement and quality/size of habitat patches that determine local population viability and connectivity."
    - name: "Source-sink dynamics"
      clarifier: "Sources have positive local growth and export dispersers; sinks have negative local growth and persist via immigration."
    - name: "Age-structured populations"
      clarifier: "Population models that track individuals by age classes, allowing age-specific survival and fecundity to determine growth and stable age distribution."

  related:
    - name: "Exponential growth model"
      clarifier: "Baseline model with constant per-capita growth; useful approximation at low density or early invasion phases."
    - name: "Logistic growth and carrying capacity"
      clarifier: "Model incorporating density dependence via a carrying capacity and negative feedback on per-capita growth."
    - name: "Allee effects"
      clarifier: "Positive density dependence at low densities due to mate limitation, cooperative defense, etc., increasing extinction risk."
    - name: "Demographic vs environmental stochasticity"
      clarifier: "Randomness from individual-level birth/death events versus temporal environmental variation; both affect persistence, especially in small populations."
    - name: "Dispersal and connectivity"
      clarifier: "Movement among patches determining rescue effects, gene flow, and colonization probability."
    - name: "Rescue effect"
      clarifier: "Immigration reducing local extinction probability and increasing persistence of patch populations."
    - name: "Life tables"
      clarifier: "Age-specific survival schedules (e.g., \\\\(l_x\\\\)) and fecundity (e.g., \\\\(m_x\\\\)) used to quantify population growth."
    - name: "Leslie matrix model"
      clarifier: "Discrete-time age-structured model using a projection matrix whose dominant eigenvalue gives long-term growth rate."
    - name: "Reproductive value"
      clarifier: "Relative contribution of individuals of different ages to future population growth."
