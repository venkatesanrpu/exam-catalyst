concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Group living (social living)"
      clarifier: "Persistent association of conspecifics; social structure ranging from loose aggregations to stable groups and societies."
    - name: "Costs and benefits of group living"
      clarifier: "Trade-offs between survival/reproduction gains (e.g., predator avoidance, foraging efficiency) and costs (competition, disease, conflict)."
    - name: "Anti-predator benefits of groups"
      clarifier: "Mechanisms including dilution, many-eyes vigilance, confusion, and collective defense; shapes group size and cohesion."
    - name: "Competition and group formation"
      clarifier: "How resource competition determines whether grouping is favored and sets optimal group size; resource distribution is key."
    - name: "Scramble competition"
      clarifier: "Exploitation competition; individuals cannot exclude others, so per-capita intake often declines as group size increases."
    - name: "Contest competition"
      clarifier: "Interference competition; individuals can exclude/monopolize resources, producing inequality and favoring dominance."
    - name: "Dominance relationships"
      clarifier: "Consistent asymmetries in aggressive interactions producing rank and hierarchies that structure access to resources and mating."
    - name: "Kin selection"
      clarifier: "Selection acting through indirect fitness gains when helping relatives; formalized by Hamilton’s rule."
    - name: "Altruism"
      clarifier: "Behaviors that reduce actor’s direct fitness while increasing recipient’s fitness; can evolve via relatedness, reciprocity, or group-structured mechanisms."
    - name: "Reciprocity"
      clarifier: "Helping based on contingent return benefits over repeated interactions; requires recognition, memory, and low cheating."
    - name: "Eusociality"
      clarifier: "Extreme sociality with reproductive division of labor, cooperative brood care, and overlapping generations; explained via kin selection and ecological factors."
    - name: "Human behaviour (behavioral ecology perspective)"
      clarifier: "Applying evolutionary logic to human cooperation, conflict, mating, and social norms while accounting for culture and gene–culture interactions."
  related:
    - name: "Hamilton’s rule"
      clarifier: "Altruism can evolve when \\( rB > C \\), where \\(r\\) is relatedness, \\(B\\) benefit to recipient, \\(C\\) cost to actor."
    - name: "Inclusive fitness"
      clarifier: "Total genetic contribution via direct reproduction plus effects on relatives’ reproduction weighted by relatedness."
    - name: "Direct vs indirect fitness"
      clarifier: "Direct fitness from own offspring; indirect fitness via aiding relatives; their sum underpins kin selection logic."
    - name: "Mutualism"
      clarifier: "Cooperation benefiting both parties immediately; distinct from altruism and often easier to maintain."
    - name: "Reciprocal altruism (Trivers)"
      clarifier: "Cooperation stabilized by repeated interactions, partner choice, and punishment/retaliation against defectors."
    - name: "By-product benefits"
      clarifier: "Helping arises as a side-effect of selfish action; can mimic altruism without fitness costs."
    - name: "Cheater problem"
      clarifier: "Risk that individuals take benefits without paying costs; central to evolution of cooperation."
    - name: "Kin recognition and discrimination"
      clarifier: "Mechanisms to direct help toward relatives (familiarity, phenotype matching, spatial cues)."
    - name: "Policing and punishment"
      clarifier: "Mechanisms that suppress cheating and stabilize cooperation (worker policing in insects, social punishment in humans)."
    - name: "Game theory in social behavior"
      clarifier: "Strategic interaction models (Prisoner’s Dilemma, Hawk–Dove, Public Goods) explaining conflict and cooperation."
    - name: "Group selection and multilevel selection"
      clarifier: "Selection acting among groups can favor cooperation when between-group variation persists and within-group cheating is controlled."
    - name: "Life-history and ecological constraints on eusociality"
      clarifier: "Monogamy, fortress defense, progressive provisioning, and high benefits of staying can promote eusociality."
    - name: "Gene–culture coevolution"
      clarifier: "Human-specific feedback between cultural practices and selection pressures (norms, institutions, mating rules)."
