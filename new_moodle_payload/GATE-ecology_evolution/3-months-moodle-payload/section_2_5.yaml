concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Coevolution"
      clarifier: "Reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species driven by natural selection imposed by each on the other; requires heritable variation and consistent interaction."
    - name: "Co-adaptations"
      clarifier: "Matched traits in interacting species that increase fitness in the interaction context (e.g., flower–pollinator trait matching); distinguishing adaptation from mere correlation."
    - name: "Evolutionary arms race"
      clarifier: "Escalating reciprocal adaptations and counter-adaptations (offense/defense) often producing rapid trait evolution and strong selection."
    - name: "Red Queen hypothesis"
      clarifier: "Continuous evolution is required to maintain relative fitness in a biotic environment that is itself evolving; commonly applied to host–parasite and predator–prey dynamics."
    - name: "Cospeciation"
      clarifier: "Parallel speciation of interacting lineages producing congruent phylogenies; typical in tight host–symbiont/parasite associations; recognizing alternative causes of congruence."
    - name: "Predator–prey interactions (evolutionary outcomes)"
      clarifier: "Selection generated by predation risk and prey defenses shaping behavior, morphology, life history, and predator counter-strategies."
    - name: "Crypsis (camouflage)"
      clarifier: "Traits that reduce detection by predators or prey via background matching, disruptive coloration, or masquerade; effectiveness depends on environment and predator perception."
    - name: "Mimicry"
      clarifier: "Resemblance to another organism/object affecting predator behavior; major forms include Batesian, Müllerian, and aggressive mimicry."
  related:
    - name: "Host–parasite coevolution"
      clarifier: "High-intensity reciprocal selection; antigenic variation, immune gene diversity, and negative frequency-dependent selection (conceptual)."
    - name: "Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution"
      clarifier: "Coevolution varies across landscapes with hotspots/coldspots, gene flow, and local adaptation."
    - name: "Frequency-dependent selection"
      clarifier: "Fitness depends on trait frequency; central to mimicry dynamics and Red Queen cycles."
    - name: "Aposematism"
      clarifier: "Warning coloration signaling unprofitability; often underpins mimicry systems."
    - name: "Behavioral ecology of predation"
      clarifier: "Optimal foraging, vigilance, and escape behavior; links ecology to evolutionary consequences."
    - name: "Sensory ecology"
      clarifier: "Predator sensory biases and perception shape which defensive signals (crypsis/aposematism/mimicry) evolve."
    - name: "Phylogenetic congruence tests (overview)"
      clarifier: "Comparing host and associate trees; distinguishing cospeciation from host switching, duplication, and sorting events."
    - name: "Constraints and trade-offs in defenses"
      clarifier: "Costs of toxins, armor, vigilance, or coloration; defenses can reduce growth or reproduction."
    - name: "Community context"
      clarifier: "Third-party species can mediate coevolution (e.g., predators shaping mimicry rings; alternative hosts altering parasite evolution)."
