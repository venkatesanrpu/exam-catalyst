concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Cost of sex"
      clarifier: "Fitness costs of sexual reproduction relative to asexuality (e.g., two-fold cost of males, costs of meiosis, mate finding, STIs), and the evolutionary benefits that can offset them."
    - name: "Sexual dimorphism"
      clarifier: "Sex differences in morphology, behavior, physiology, and life history arising from sexual selection, fecundity selection, and ecological divergence."
    - name: "Mate choice"
      clarifier: "Non-random mating preferences and decision rules; choosiness vs sampling costs; direct and indirect benefits."
    - name: "Sexual selection"
      clarifier: "Selection arising from variance in mating success; includes intra-sexual competition and inter-sexual choice."
    - name: "Runaway (Fisherian) selection"
      clarifier: "Positive feedback between female preference and male trait leading to exaggerated traits under certain genetic correlations."
    - name: "Good-genes sexual selection"
      clarifier: "Mate choice favors traits indicating heritable viability/quality; predicts offspring fitness benefits and condition dependence."
    - name: "Handicap principle"
      clarifier: "Costly traits can be reliable signals of quality if costs are differentially affordable by high-quality individuals."
    - name: "Sexual conflict"
      clarifier: "Divergent reproductive interests between sexes leading to antagonistic coevolution (pre- and post-copulatory)."
    - name: "Mating systems"
      clarifier: "Patterns of mating and pair association (monogamy, polygyny, polyandry, promiscuity) shaped by ecology and parental investment."
    - name: "Parental care"
      clarifier: "Any parental trait increasing offspring survival at a cost to parents; includes provisioning, guarding, incubation, and teaching."
  related:
    - name: "Anisogamy and Bateman’s principle"
      clarifier: "Gamete size differences underpin sex roles; mating success variance often higher in the sex with lower parental investment."
    - name: "Operational sex ratio (OSR)"
      clarifier: "Ratio of sexually active males to receptive females; predicts intensity of competition and mate choice."
    - name: "Parental investment theory (Trivers)"
      clarifier: "The sex investing more in offspring becomes choosier; the other competes more intensely."
    - name: "Sperm competition and cryptic female choice"
      clarifier: "Post-copulatory sexual selection via ejaculate competition and female-mediated bias in fertilization."
    - name: "Alternative reproductive tactics"
      clarifier: "Sneaking, satellites, and conditional strategies; frequency-dependent selection and state dependence."
    - name: "Sex role reversal"
      clarifier: "When males provide more care and become choosier; often linked to OSR and ecology."
    - name: "Fecundity selection"
      clarifier: "Selection on traits increasing reproductive output (often female body size) distinct from sexual selection."
    - name: "Life-history trade-offs"
      clarifier: "Current reproduction vs future survival/fecundity; clutch size vs offspring quality."
    - name: "Inclusive fitness and kin selection in care"
      clarifier: "Helping and cooperative breeding explained by relatedness and indirect fitness benefits."
    - name: "Parent–offspring conflict"
      clarifier: "Offspring demand exceeds parental optimum; leads to conflict over provisioning and weaning."
