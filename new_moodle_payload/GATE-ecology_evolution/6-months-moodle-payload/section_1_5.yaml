concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Ecosystem structure"
      clarifier: "Biotic and abiotic components arranged into functional compartments (producers, consumers, decomposers, detritus) and their standing stocks (biomass, nutrient pools)."
    - name: "Trophic levels"
      clarifier: "Feeding-position categories (primary producers, primary/secondary/tertiary consumers, decomposers) used to summarize energy and matter transfer in food chains/webs."
    - name: "Food chains and food webs"
      clarifier: "Linear and network representations of who eats whom, capturing pathways of energy flow and interaction strengths among trophic levels."
    - name: "Trophic interactions"
      clarifier: "Effects among trophic levels including consumption, top-down control, bottom-up limitation, and indirect effects such as trophic cascades."
    - name: "Nutrient cycles (biogeochemical cycles)"
      clarifier: "Movement and transformation of elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) among atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere through biological and abiotic processes."
    - name: "Primary productivity"
      clarifier: "Rate at which autotrophs fix carbon into organic matter; includes gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP)."
    - name: "Secondary productivity"
      clarifier: "Rate at which heterotrophs convert assimilated energy into new biomass (growth and reproduction) at consumer trophic levels."

  related:
    - name: "Energy flow vs nutrient cycling"
      clarifier: "Energy flows one-way through ecosystems (with losses as heat), while nutrients cycle among pools and are conserved in matter transformations."
    - name: "Ecological efficiency and trophic transfer efficiency"
      clarifier: "Fraction of energy/biomass transferred between trophic levels, often summarized conceptually as \u223c10% but variable by system and trophic pathway."
    - name: "Detrital pathway and decomposition"
      clarifier: "Transfer of organic matter to detritus and decomposers; major route of energy and nutrient recycling in many ecosystems."
    - name: "Stoichiometry and nutrient limitation"
      clarifier: "Elemental ratios (e.g., C:N:P) shaping nutrient demand, limitation, and consumer-resource interactions."
    - name: "Mineralization and immobilization"
      clarifier: "Microbial conversion of organic nutrients to inorganic forms (mineralization) versus uptake and incorporation into biomass (immobilization)."
    - name: "Nitrogen transformations"
      clarifier: "Key processes such as fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification linking biology to N availability."
    - name: "Phosphorus cycle characteristics"
      clarifier: "Sedimentary-dominated cycle with no major atmospheric gaseous phase, often making P limiting on long timescales."
    - name: "Bottom-up vs top-down control"
      clarifier: "Resource-driven limitation of higher trophic levels versus predator-driven regulation of lower trophic levels and cascades."
    - name: "Standing crop and turnover"
      clarifier: "Biomass present at a given time versus rate of production; systems can have low biomass but high turnover (e.g., plankton)."
