concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Variation"
      clarifier: "Phenotypic and genetic differences among individuals; continuous vs discontinuous variation; standing variation vs new mutation as substrates for evolution."
    - name: "Heritability"
      clarifier: "Quantifying the genetic contribution to phenotypic variance; broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability; implications and limitations for predicting response to selection."
    - name: "Natural selection"
      clarifier: "Non-random differential survival and reproduction among heritable variants; selection acts on phenotypes but changes allele frequencies in populations."
    - name: "Fitness"
      clarifier: "Relative reproductive success; absolute vs relative fitness; components (viability, mating success, fecundity) and context dependence."
    - name: "Adaptation"
      clarifier: "A heritable trait shaped by selection that increases fitness in a specific environment; distinguishing adaptation (process/trait) from acclimation and from 'beneficial' in all contexts."
    - name: "Types of selection"
      clarifier: "Stabilizing, directional, and disruptive selection; expected changes in mean and variance of traits and consequences for polymorphism."
  related:
    - name: "Genotype–phenotype map"
      clarifier: "How alleles produce phenotypes via development; dominance, epistasis, and pleiotropy affect observed variation and selection response."
    - name: "Phenotypic plasticity"
      clarifier: "Environmentally induced phenotypic change; reaction norms; can mimic genetic adaptation but does not necessarily change allele frequencies."
    - name: "Sources of genetic variation"
      clarifier: "Mutation, recombination, gene flow, and standing genetic variation; why selection cannot create variation."
    - name: "Quantitative genetics"
      clarifier: "Polygenic traits, normal distributions, and selection on continuous traits; selection differential and response to selection."
    - name: "Hardy–Weinberg baseline"
      clarifier: "Null model for allele/genotype frequencies; helps detect selection and other evolutionary forces."
    - name: "Trade-offs and constraints"
      clarifier: "Costs of traits, antagonistic pleiotropy, and genetic correlations; why 'optimal' phenotypes are not always achieved."
    - name: "Selection coefficients and selection gradients"
      clarifier: "Ways to quantify selection intensity on genotypes/phenotypes; interpreting sign and magnitude."
    - name: "Inclusive fitness (high-level)"
      clarifier: "Fitness can include effects on relatives; useful for interpreting adaptation in social contexts (overview only)."
