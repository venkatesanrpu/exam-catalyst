concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Community assembly"
      clarifier: "Processes determining which species occur together locally, including dispersal, environmental filtering, biotic interactions, priority effects, and historical contingency."
    - name: "Community organization"
      clarifier: "How communities are structured in space and time (trophic structure, guilds, interaction networks, dominance patterns) and how these features emerge from assembly processes."
    - name: "Ecological succession"
      clarifier: "Directional change in community composition after disturbance or on new substrate, often described as primary vs secondary succession with early- to late-successional stages."
    - name: "Species richness"
      clarifier: "Number of species present in a defined area/sample; a count metric sensitive to sampling effort."
    - name: "Evenness"
      clarifier: "How similar species' abundances are within a community; high evenness means less dominance by few species."
    - name: "Diversity indices"
      clarifier: "Quantitative measures combining richness and relative abundance (e.g., Shannon and Simpson indices) to compare communities."
    - name: "Species-area relationship (SAR)"
      clarifier: "Empirical relationship where species richness increases with area, commonly modeled as \\(S = cA^z\\), used for scaling and extinction projections."
    - name: "Theory of island biogeography"
      clarifier: "MacArthur-Wilson framework where island species richness reflects a dynamic equilibrium between colonization and extinction, shaped by island isolation and area."

  related:
    - name: "Environmental filtering"
      clarifier: "Abiotic constraints permitting only species with suitable traits to establish, shaping composition and trait distributions."
    - name: "Dispersal limitation"
      clarifier: "Failure of species to reach suitable sites, producing spatial turnover independent of local suitability."
    - name: "Priority effects"
      clarifier: "Early-arriving species influencing later establishment via niche preemption or habitat modification, creating alternative stable community states."
    - name: "Facilitation, tolerance, and inhibition models of succession"
      clarifier: "Classic conceptual models describing how early species influence later species establishment during succession."
    - name: "Intermediate disturbance hypothesis"
      clarifier: "Hypothesis that diversity peaks at intermediate disturbance frequency/intensity via coexistence of colonizers and competitors."
    - name: "Alpha, beta, gamma diversity"
      clarifier: "Diversity within sites, among sites, and at regional scale; links local richness to turnover and regional species pools."
    - name: "Rarefaction and sampling effort"
      clarifier: "Methods for comparing richness/diversity across unequal sample sizes or effort."
    - name: "Rank-abundance curves"
      clarifier: "Graphical summaries of dominance and evenness that complement numeric indices."
    - name: "Nestedness and turnover in island/fragment communities"
      clarifier: "Patterns of species composition where smaller sites hold subsets of larger ones (nestedness) versus replacement (turnover)."
    - name: "Habitat fragmentation as 'islands'"
      clarifier: "Application of island biogeography ideas to terrestrial habitat patches embedded in a matrix."
