concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Species interactions (interaction types)"
      clarifier: "Classification of interspecific interactions by fitness effects on each partner (e.g., \\(+\\!/\\!+\\), \\(+\\!/\\!0\\), \\(-\\!/\\!-\\), \\(+\\!/\\!-\\)) and the mechanisms that generate them."
    - name: "Mutualism"
      clarifier: "Interaction where both partners gain fitness benefits; can be obligate or facultative and may involve exchange of resources or services."
    - name: "Symbiosis"
      clarifier: "Intimate, long-term association between species that can be mutualistic, commensal, or parasitic; describes closeness, not benefit sign."
    - name: "Commensalism"
      clarifier: "Interaction where one species benefits while the other has no measurable fitness effect under the conditions studied."
    - name: "Competition"
      clarifier: "Negative interaction due to shared limiting resources; includes exploitative (indirect) and interference (direct) competition."
    - name: "Parasitism"
      clarifier: "Consumer-resource interaction where the parasite benefits and the host is harmed, typically without immediate host death; includes micro- and macroparasites."
    - name: "Predation"
      clarifier: "Consumer-resource interaction where the predator kills and consumes the prey, affecting prey abundance, traits, and community structure."
    - name: "Ecophysiology"
      clarifier: "Study of how physiological traits and constraints determine organism performance across abiotic gradients (temperature, water, salinity, oxygen, light)."
    - name: "Physiological adaptation to abiotic environment"
      clarifier: "Heritable trait changes (and associated mechanisms) that improve performance and fitness under specific abiotic conditions; distinct from short-term acclimation."
    - name: "Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model"
      clarifier: "Coupled differential equations describing predator and prey dynamics under simplified assumptions, producing characteristic oscillations."

  related:
    - name: "Interaction outcomes and context dependence"
      clarifier: "Net outcomes can shift with environment, density, and life stage (e.g., mutualism to parasitism along stress gradients)."
    - name: "Functional response (Holling types)"
      clarifier: "Relationship between prey density and predator consumption rate; key extension beyond basic Lotka-Volterra assumptions."
    - name: "Numerical response"
      clarifier: "Change in predator density via reproduction/aggregation as prey density changes; links individual feeding to population dynamics."
    - name: "Apparent competition"
      clarifier: "Indirect negative interaction between prey species mediated by a shared predator."
    - name: "Keystone predation and trophic cascades"
      clarifier: "Predation disproportionately shaping community composition and propagating effects across trophic levels."
    - name: "Competitive exclusion and coexistence"
      clarifier: "Conditions under which species cannot stably coexist on the same limiting resource versus mechanisms enabling coexistence (niche differentiation)."
    - name: "Character displacement"
      clarifier: "Evolutionary divergence in traits due to competition, reducing niche overlap in sympatry."
    - name: "Thermal performance curves and Q10"
      clarifier: "How performance changes with temperature, including metabolic scaling concepts often used in ecophysiology."
    - name: "Osmoregulation and water balance"
      clarifier: "Physiological mechanisms controlling ion and water balance in terrestrial and aquatic environments."
    - name: "Acclimation vs adaptation"
      clarifier: "Reversible phenotypic adjustment within an individual versus heritable change across generations."
