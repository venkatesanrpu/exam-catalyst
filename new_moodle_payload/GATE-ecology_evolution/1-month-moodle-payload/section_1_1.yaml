    - name: "Levels (scales) of ecological organization"
      clarifier: "Hierarchical scales used to study ecology: population, species, community, ecosystem, and biome, each with distinct patterns, processes, and measurements."
    - name: "Ecological niche"
      clarifier: "The multidimensional set of conditions and resources defining where a species can persist and how it affects and is affected by the environment (role + requirements)."
    - name: "Habitat"
      clarifier: "The physical place or environment where an organism lives; a spatial concept often linked to vegetation, substrate, and climate."

  related:
    - name: "Species concept (ecological relevance)"
      clarifier: "Operational meaning of species for ecological studies (often biological/ecological species concepts) and implications for measuring diversity and interactions."
    - name: "Population attributes"
      clarifier: "Key descriptors such as size, density, dispersion, age structure, and growth rate used at the population scale."
    - name: "Community interactions"
      clarifier: "Core interaction types (competition, predation, mutualism, commensalism, parasitism) that connect biotic components to community patterns."
    - name: "Ecosystem processes"
      clarifier: "Energy flow and nutrient cycling as emergent properties at the ecosystem scale linking biotic and abiotic components."
    - name: "Biome classification"
      clarifier: "Broad ecosystem types defined primarily by climate and dominant vegetation (e.g., tundra, tropical rainforest), used for large-scale comparisons."
    - name: "Niche partitioning and coexistence"
      clarifier: "Mechanisms by which species reduce overlap in resource use, enabling stable coexistence within communities."
    - name: "Fundamental vs realized niche"
      clarifier: "Potential niche set by abiotic limits versus actual niche constrained by biotic interactions and dispersal."
    - name: "Habitat selection and habitat suitability"
      clarifier: "Behavioral and demographic basis for choosing habitats; suitability measured via survival and reproduction, not just presence."
