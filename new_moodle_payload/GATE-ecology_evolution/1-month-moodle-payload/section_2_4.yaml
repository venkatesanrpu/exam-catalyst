concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Life-history strategies (framework)"
      clarifier: "Integrated schedules of growth, reproduction, and survival shaped by natural selection under ecological constraints; comparisons across species and environments."
    - name: "Resource allocation"
      clarifier: "Partitioning limited energy/time among maintenance, growth, storage, and reproduction; allocation decisions determine life-history traits such as age at maturity and fecundity."
    - name: "Trade-offs"
      clarifier: "Fitness costs arising because improving one life-history trait reduces another (e.g., current vs future reproduction, number vs size of offspring)."
    - name: "r/K selection (classic heuristic)"
      clarifier: "Contrasting selection in low-density/unstable vs high-density/competitive environments; what it predicts and why it is considered a simplification."
    - name: "Semelparity"
      clarifier: "Single reproductive episode followed by death; favored when adult survival after reproduction is low or when a large one-time reproductive effort yields high fitness."
    - name: "Iteroparity"
      clarifier: "Multiple reproductive episodes across lifetime; favored when adult survival is sufficiently high and spreading reproduction reduces risk across variable environments."
    - name: "Comparing parity modes"
      clarifier: "How ecology (mortality, seasonality, predictability) and physiology constrain whether semelparity or iteroparity evolves."
  related:
    - name: "Fitness components and reproductive value"
      clarifier: "Age-specific survival and fecundity determine fitness; reproductive value links timing of reproduction to selection strength."
    - name: "Cost of reproduction"
      clarifier: "Physiological and ecological costs of reproduction reducing survival or future fecundity; central empirical support for trade-offs."
    - name: "Age at first reproduction"
      clarifier: "Early vs delayed maturity as an allocation outcome; influenced by mortality risk and growth benefits."
    - name: "Offspring size–number trade-off"
      clarifier: "Smith–Fretwell logic: optimal offspring size under diminishing returns and resource limits."
    - name: "Bet-hedging (overview)"
      clarifier: "Strategies that reduce variance in reproductive success across unpredictable environments, potentially favoring iteroparity or variable clutch sizes."
    - name: "Density dependence"
      clarifier: "How population density affects survival/fecundity; connects directly to classic r/K reasoning."
    - name: "Environmental stochasticity"
      clarifier: "Unpredictable variation affecting survival and reproduction; key driver of spreading reproductive effort over time."
    - name: "Phenotypic plasticity in life histories"
      clarifier: "Condition-dependent allocation and flexible reproductive schedules; reaction norms for age/size at maturity."
    - name: "Survivorship curves"
      clarifier: "Type I/II/III curves and their relation to life-history patterns and juvenile vs adult mortality."
