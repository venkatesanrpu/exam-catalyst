concepts:
  core:
    - name: "Neutral theory of molecular evolution"
      clarifier: "Most molecular substitutions are selectively neutral (or nearly neutral) and fixed by drift; distinguishes molecular evolution patterns from phenotypic adaptation."
    - name: "Nearly neutral theory (exam-relevant extension)"
      clarifier: "Many mutations have very small effects; the boundary between drift and selection depends on effective population size \\(N_e\\)."
    - name: "Molecular clocks"
      clarifier: "Using approximate constancy of substitution rates to estimate divergence times; calibration requirements and reasons clocks deviate from strict constancy."
    - name: "Rates of evolution"
      clarifier: "Distinguishing mutation rate vs substitution rate; factors affecting rates across genes, lineages, and sites (constraints, generation time, repair, selection)."
    - name: "Phylogenetic reconstruction"
      clarifier: "Inferring evolutionary relationships from character data (often sequences); tree components, rooting, and choosing optimal trees under explicit criteria/models."
    - name: "Molecular systematics"
      clarifier: "Using molecular data to delimit species, infer relationships, test monophyly, and revise classification; integrating molecular and morphological evidence."
  related:
    - name: "Genetic drift and fixation"
      clarifier: "Fixation probability and time under drift; why neutral substitutions accumulate approximately linearly with time."
    - name: "Effective population size \\(N_e\\)"
      clarifier: "Determines strength of drift; key parameter in nearly neutral theory and rate variation among lineages."
    - name: "Synonymous vs nonsynonymous substitutions"
      clarifier: "Coding-sequence changes with different selection regimes; basis for \\(d_N/d_S\\) interpretation."
    - name: "Purifying selection and constraint"
      clarifier: "Removal of deleterious mutations slows substitution; strong driver of rate heterogeneity across sites and genes."
    - name: "Positive selection (molecular signatures)"
      clarifier: "Episodes of adaptive substitution; conceptual link to elevated nonsynonymous changes in specific contexts."
    - name: "Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)"
      clarifier: "Homology statement at the nucleotide/amino-acid level; alignment quality strongly affects tree inference."
    - name: "Models of sequence evolution"
      clarifier: "Substitution models (e.g., Jukes–Cantor, K2P, GTR) and rate heterogeneity (gamma, invariant sites) as foundations for likelihood/Bayesian inference."
    - name: "Distance methods"
      clarifier: "Neighbor-joining/UPGMA concepts; how distances are computed and what assumptions they embed (e.g., ultrametricity)."
    - name: "Parsimony, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference"
      clarifier: "Three major inference paradigms; trade-offs, assumptions, and typical outputs (trees, support values)."
    - name: "Support and uncertainty"
      clarifier: "Bootstrapping, posterior probabilities, and why 'a tree' is a hypothesis with uncertainty."
    - name: "Rooting and outgroups"
      clarifier: "Determining direction of evolution; pitfalls when outgroups are too distant (long-branch attraction)."
    - name: "Gene trees vs species trees"
      clarifier: "Discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting, introgression, and gene duplication/loss; implications for molecular systematics."
    - name: "Orthology vs paralogy"
      clarifier: "Correct identification of homolog types is essential; paralogs can mislead phylogeny if treated as orthologs."
    - name: "Long-branch attraction (LBA)"
      clarifier: "Systematic error where fast-evolving lineages cluster incorrectly; mitigated by better models and sampling."
