concepts:
  core:
  - name: Fast Reaction Kinetics
    clarifier: Study of reactions with very short lifetimes where conventional mixing
      and sampling methods fail; microsecond to nanosecond timescales.
  - name: Relaxation Methods
    clarifier: Perturbation techniques (e.g., temperature-jump, pressure-jump, electric-field-jump)
      that disturb equilibrium and monitor relaxation back to equilibrium.
  - name: Flow Methods
    clarifier: Rapid mixing techniques (e.g., stopped-flow, continuous-flow) to observe
      kinetics of fast reactions immediately after mixing reactants.
  - name: Diffusion-Controlled Reactions
    clarifier: Reactions whose rates are limited by diffusion of reactants in solution
      rather than intrinsic chemical activation; Smoluchowski model.
  - name: Photochemical Kinetics
    clarifier: Kinetics of reactions initiated by light absorption leading to chemical
      change through excited states and reactive intermediates.
  - name: Photophysical Processes
    clarifier: Non-chemical-change deactivation pathways of excited states such as
      fluorescence, phosphorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing.
  related:
  - name: Reaction Timescales and Instrument Response
    clarifier: Classification of reactions by characteristic time domain and matching
      them to suitable experimental techniques.
  - name: Transient Species and Relaxation to Equilibrium
    clarifier: Observation of short-lived intermediates and return to equilibrium
      after a small perturbation.
  - name: Stopped-Flow Instrumentation
    clarifier: Design and operation of stopped-flow apparatus including mixing dead
      time and detection systems.
  - name: Smoluchowski Theory
    clarifier: Diffusion-controlled rate expression for bimolecular reactions in solution
      based on relative diffusion of reactants.
  - name: Jablonski Diagram
    clarifier: Energy-level scheme illustrating electronic states and photophysical
      pathways between them.
  - name: Fluorescence Quenching and Stern–Volmer Analysis
    clarifier: Dynamic and static quenching kinetics; linear and modified Stern–Volmer
      relations.
  - name: Quantum Yield
    clarifier: Ratio of events of a given type (reaction, emission) to photons absorbed;
      connection to excited-state kinetics.
  - name: Laser Flash Photolysis
    clarifier: Pulsed photochemical technique for creating and monitoring transient
      species on very short timescales.
