  syllabus_line: Reaction Mechanisms - Basic mechanistic concepts – kinetic versus
    thermodynamic control, Hammond’s postulate and Curtin-Hammett principle. Methods
    of determining reaction mechanisms through kinetics, identification of products,
    intermediates and isotopic labelling. Linear free-energy relationship – Hammett
    and Taft equations. Nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions (both
    aromatic and aliphatic). Addition reactions to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom
    (N and O) multiple bonds. Elimination reactions.
concepts:
  core:
  - name: Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Control
    clarifier: The principle that reaction conditions and energy barriers determine
      whether product distribution is governed by activation energy (kinetic) or overall
      free energy change (thermodynamic)

      energy (reactant, intermediate, or product) along the reaction coordinate

      where the major product arises from the more reactive, not necessarily more
      stable, conformer
