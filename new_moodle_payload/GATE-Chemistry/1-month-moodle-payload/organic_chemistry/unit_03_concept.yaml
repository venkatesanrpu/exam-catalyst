    arynes and free radicals. Molecular rearrangements.
concepts:
  core:
  - name: Carbocations
    clarifier: Positively charged carbon intermediates with vacant p-orbital, classified
      as primary, secondary, tertiary, allylic, benzylic, with stability governed
      by hyperconjugation and resonance
  - name: Carbanions
    clarifier: Negatively charged carbon species with lone pair, stabilized by adjacent
      electronegative atoms, resonance, or s-character
  - name: Carbenes
    clarifier: Neutral divalent carbon intermediates with six valence electrons, existing
      as singlet or triplet spin states
  - name: Nitrenes
    clarifier: Neutral monovalent nitrogen intermediates analogous to carbenes, highly
      reactive with insertion and addition capabilities
  - name: Free Radicals
    clarifier: Neutral species with unpaired electron, exhibiting paramagnetism and
      participating in chain reactions
  - name: Arynes
    clarifier: Highly strained benzene derivatives with formal triple bond, generated
      by base-induced elimination from aryl halides
  - name: Molecular Rearrangements
    clarifier: Intramolecular migrations of atoms or groups via cationic, anionic,
      radical, or pericyclic pathways
  related:
  - name: Hyperconjugation
    clarifier: Delocalization of σ-electrons into adjacent empty or partially filled
      p-orbitals stabilizing charged intermediates
  - name: Inductive Effects
    clarifier: Electron-withdrawing or donating effects through σ-bonds influencing
      intermediate stability
  - name: Resonance Stabilization
    clarifier: Delocalization of charge through π-systems in allylic and benzylic
      intermediates
  - name: Singlet vs Triplet States
    clarifier: Electronic spin configurations determining carbene and nitrene reactivity
      patterns
  - name: Radical Initiation Methods
    clarifier: Photolysis, thermolysis, and redox methods for generating radical species
  - name: Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangements
    clarifier: 1,2-shifts of alkyl or hydride groups in carbocation intermediates
  - name: Pericyclic Rearrangements
    clarifier: Concerted rearrangements proceeding through cyclic transition states
  - name: Anchimeric Assistance
    clarifier: Neighboring group participation stabilizing reactive intermediates
