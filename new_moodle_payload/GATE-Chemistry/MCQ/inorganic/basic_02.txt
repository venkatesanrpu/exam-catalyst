1) In diborane (B₂H₆), the two hydrogen atoms that bridge the boron atoms are best described as being involved in:
A. Normal 2-center–2-electron B–H σ bonds to one boron each
B. Three-center–two-electron bonding involving B–H–B
C. Hydrogen bonding between BH₃ units
D. Four-center–four-electron bonding involving B–B–H–H  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Diborane is electron-deficient and contains two bridging hydrogens that form 3-center–2-electron (3c–2e) “banana” bonds over a B–H–B framework, which helps stabilize the structure despite insufficient electrons for all classical 2c–2e bonds.  The normal terminal B–H bonds are 2c–2e, but the *bridging* hydrogens are not.  Hydrogen bonding does not explain diborane’s bonding and there is no standard 4c–4e description needed here.

2) Wade’s rules are primarily used to:
A. Predict the acidity of oxoacids
B. Predict the shapes of coordination complexes
C. Classify and predict structures of borane/carborane clusters
D. Determine lattice energies of ionic solids  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Wade’s rules are part of cluster chemistry and are used to predict/relate cluster structure types such as closo, nido, and arachno based on skeletal electron counting.  They are central for boranes and carboranes where electron-deficient bonding and polyhedral structures occur.  The other options refer to different topics (oxoacid trends, coordination chemistry, ionic solids) not targeted by Wade’s rules.

3) The terms closo, nido, and arachno in borane chemistry refer to:
A. Types of hybridization at boron
B. Skeletal types of cluster frameworks (closed vs. open)
C. Types of boron isotopes
D. Types of solvents used to prepare boranes  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Closo, nido, and arachno describe how “complete” the polyhedral cluster is: closo is a closed polyhedron, while nido/arachno are progressively more open frameworks derived conceptually by removing vertices from a closo parent.  This classification links directly to skeletal electron counting and cluster geometry.  Hybridization language alone does not capture these polyhedral cluster types, and isotopes/solvents are unrelated.

4) Carboranes are best defined as:
A. Simple ionic salts of boron and carbon
B. Boron–carbon cluster compounds with cage-like structures
C. Linear polymers containing alternating B and C atoms
D. Compounds containing only B–C double bonds  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Carboranes are boron–carbon cluster (cage) compounds, often with icosahedral or related nido/arachno structures, and are treated using cluster concepts similar to boranes.  They are not simple ionic salts and are not primarily described as linear polymers.  Their bonding is delocalized and polyhedral rather than being dominated by isolated B=C double bonds.

5) The backbone of silicones (organosilicon polymers) consists mainly of:
A. Si–Si chains
B. Si–O chains with organic substituents on Si
C. C–C chains with Si side groups
D. Alternating Si–N chains  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Silicones have a Si–O–Si backbone (a siloxane chain/network) with organic substituents attached to silicon, giving characteristic flexibility and stability.  Si–Si chains correspond more to polysilanes, while Si–N backbones are characteristic of other inorganic polymer families (e.g., phosphazene-related themes involve P–N, not Si–N).  A pure carbon backbone would describe organic polymers rather than silicones.

6) Silicates are commonly classified (neso-, soro-, cyclo-, ino-, phyllo-, tecto-) based on:
A. Oxidation state of silicon
B. Degree of polymerization/connectivity of SiO₄ tetrahedra
C. Number of neutrons in silicon isotopes
D. Magnetic properties of minerals  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Silicate classes are defined by how SiO₄ tetrahedra share oxygen atoms to form isolated units, pairs, rings, chains, sheets, or 3D frameworks (increasing polymerization/connectivity).  This structural basis explains their diverse stoichiometries and mineral structures.  Oxidation state of Si is typically +4 in most silicates and does not define these categories.

7) Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is most closely analogous (isoelectronic/structural motif) to:
A. Diamond
B. Graphite
C. Sodium chloride
D. White phosphorus (P₄)  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: h-BN has a layered structure analogous to graphite and is often discussed as an isoelectronic analog within the carbon allotrope theme.  Diamond is a 3D tetrahedral network (closer to cubic BN, c-BN, by analogy), not layered like h-BN.  NaCl and P₄ do not match the layered sp²-like sheet motif.

8) Borazine (B₃N₃H₆) is often called “inorganic benzene” mainly because it:
A. Is ionic and forms benzene-like salts
B. Has a six-membered ring with alternating atoms and shows aromatic character
C. Has the same boiling point as benzene
D. Contains only carbon–carbon bonds like benzene  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Borazine is a six-membered ring compound with alternating B and N atoms and is discussed for its aromaticity and π-electron distribution, giving a benzene-like ring analogy.  It is not ionic by default, and similarity is not based on boiling point.  It contains B–N bonds rather than C–C bonds, so “same bonding as benzene” is incorrect.

9) Phosphazenes are characterized by the presence of:
A. A P–N ring/chain framework with P–N bonding (often with P=N character)
B. Only P–P single bonds
C. Only N–N single bonds
D. A Si–O backbone  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Phosphazenes are inorganic ring/chain (and sometimes cage) compounds built on a P–N framework, and are treated as an important class of inorganic polymers.  P–P-only or N–N-only bonding would not describe phosphazenes.  A Si–O backbone is the defining motif of silicones, not phosphazenes.

10) Which statement correctly matches a carbon allotrope to its bonding/structure?
A. Diamond: layered sp² sheets with weak interlayer forces
B. Graphite: 3D sp³ tetrahedral network
C. Graphene: a two-dimensional sp² sheet
D. Fullerenes: infinite 3D sp³ framework only  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Graphene is a single two-dimensional sheet of sp²-bonded carbon atoms and is explicitly treated as a distinct carbon allotrope alongside diamond, graphite, and fullerenes.  Diamond is a 3D sp³ network, while graphite is layered sp² sheets with weak van der Waals interlayer interactions, so options A and B swap key features.  Fullerenes are closed cages (e.g., C₆₀) rather than an infinite 3D sp³ framework.
