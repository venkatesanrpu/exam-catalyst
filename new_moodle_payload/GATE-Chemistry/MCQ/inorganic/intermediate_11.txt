1) A solution shows absorbance \(A=0.650\) at a given wavelength in a 1.00 cm cuvette, and the molar absorptivity is \(\varepsilon = 1.30\times 10^4\ \mathrm{L\,mol^{-1}\,cm^{-1}}\). The concentration of the absorbing species is:
A. \(5.0\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\)  
B. \(5.0\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\)  
C. \(5.0\times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\)  
D. \(5.0\times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Quantitative UV–Visible analysis commonly uses Beer–Lambert law \(A=\varepsilon l c\).
Rearranging gives \(c = A/(\varepsilon l) = 0.650/(1.30\times 10^4 \times 1.00)=5.0\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\).
Answers differing by factors of 10 typically come from power-of-ten slips in \(\varepsilon\) or treating 1 cm as 10 cm.
Very large concentrations here would imply unrealistically high absorbance for typical UV–Vis linear ranges, indicating misuse of the proportionality.

2) In fluorescence measurements, a sample has radiative rate constant \(k_r = 2.0\times 10^8\ \mathrm{s^{-1}}\) and non-radiative rate constant \(k_{nr} = 8.0\times 10^8\ \mathrm{s^{-1}}\). The fluorescence quantum yield \(\Phi_F\) is:
A. 0.20  
B. 0.40  
C. 0.60  
D. 0.80  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Fluorescence efficiency depends on competition between radiative and non-radiative deactivation pathways discussed via Jablonski-type reasoning.
The quantum yield is \(\Phi_F = \dfrac{k_r}{k_r+k_{nr}} = \dfrac{2.0}{2.0+8.0} = 0.20\).
Higher values arise if \(k_{nr}\) is mistakenly subtracted or ignored, which incorrectly assumes no quenching or internal conversion.
Values above 0.5 would require radiative decay to dominate, which is not the case for the given rate constants.

***

3) An FTIR band appears at 1700 cm\(^{-1}\). The corresponding frequency (in Hz) is closest to: (Use \(c=3.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{cm\,s^{-1}}\)).
A. \(5.1\times 10^{11}\)  
B. \(5.1\times 10^{12}\)  
C. \(5.1\times 10^{13}\)  
D. \(5.1\times 10^{14}\)  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: FTIR interpretation uses the frequency–wavenumber relationship \(\nu = c\tilde{\nu}\), where \(\tilde{\nu}\) is in cm\(^{-1}\).
So \(\nu = (3.0\times 10^{10})(1700)=5.1\times 10^{13}\ \mathrm{s^{-1}}\).
A common mistake is using \(c=3.0\times 10^8\ \mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}\) without converting 1700 cm\(^{-1}\) into m\(^{-1}\), causing a factor-of-100 error.
Another error is treating wavenumber as wavelength directly, which inverts the relationship.

***

4) In a \(^1\)H NMR spectrum, a proton signal at 2.50 ppm is observed on a 400 MHz instrument. The frequency separation from TMS (in Hz) is:
A. 100 Hz  
B. 400 Hz  
C. 1000 Hz  
D. 2500 Hz  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Chemical shift is defined by \(\delta(\mathrm{ppm})=\dfrac{\Delta \nu(\mathrm{Hz})}{\nu_0(\mathrm{MHz})}\), consistent with chemical-shift scale concepts used for NMR interpretation.
Thus \(\Delta\nu = \delta \nu_0 = 2.50\times 400=1000\ \mathrm{Hz}\).
Using 400 as Hz instead of MHz incorrectly reduces the answer by a factor of \(10^6\).
Taking ppm as percent (dividing by 100) is another common misconception that yields much smaller incorrect separations.

***

5) An ESR experiment uses microwave frequency \(\nu = 9.5\ \mathrm{GHz}\). For a radical with \(g\approx 2.00\), the approximate magnetic field \(B\) at resonance is closest to (Use \(h=6.63\times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{J\,s}\), \(\mu_B=9.27\times 10^{-24}\ \mathrm{J\,T^{-1}}\), and \(h\nu=g\mu_B B\)).
A. 0.034 T  
B. 0.34 T  
C. 3.4 T  
D. 34 T  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: ESR resonance condition connects microwave frequency, g-factor, and magnetic field, aligning with ESR resonance and g-factor concepts.
Compute \(B=\dfrac{h\nu}{g\mu_B}=\dfrac{6.63\times 10^{-34}\times 9.5\times 10^9}{2.00\times 9.27\times 10^{-24}}\approx 0.34\ \mathrm{T}\).
An answer ten times smaller usually comes from using \(\nu\) in MHz rather than GHz.
An answer ten times larger can come from forgetting the factor \(g\) in the denominator or misplacing powers of ten in \(\mu_B\).

***

6) In EI mass spectrometry, a molecule of molecular mass 78 gives a molecular ion at \(m/z=78\) and a fragment at \(m/z=77\). The most plausible interpretation of the \(m/z=77\) peak is:
A. Loss of H-  from the molecular ion to give \([M - H]^+\)  
B. Gain of H-  to give \([M + H]^+\)  
C. Loss of CO to give \([M - 28]^+\)  
D. Formation of a doubly charged molecular ion \([M]^{2+}\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: EI commonly produces a radical cation molecular ion that undergoes fragmentation, and a 1 unit decrease in m/z is typically consistent with loss of a hydrogen radical.
A 1 unit increase is more characteristic of protonation processes common in soft ionization methods like CI/ESI, not classic EI behavior.
Loss of CO would shift m/z by 28 units, which does not match the observed 78 to 77 change.
A doubly charged ion would appear at roughly half the m/z value (about 39), not at 77.

***

7) In AAS, an element is measured using a calibration curve where absorbance varies linearly with concentration. If the absorbance of a standard solution (2.0 ppm) is 0.300 and a sample gives 0.450 under identical conditions, the sample concentration is:
A. 1.0 ppm  
B. 2.0 ppm  
C. 3.0 ppm  
D. 4.5 ppm  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Quantitative AAS commonly relies on calibration and Beer–Lambert-type proportionality between absorbance and concentration in a linear working range.
With direct proportionality, \(C_{sample}=C_{std}\times(A_{sample}/A_{std})=2.0\times(0.450/0.300)=3.0\ \mathrm{ppm}\).
Choosing 4.5 ppm results from assuming absorbance equals concentration numerically without scaling.
Choosing 1.0 ppm results from inverting the ratio, which would incorrectly imply higher absorbance means lower concentration.

***

8) In X-ray diffraction using Cu K\(\alpha\) radiation (\(\lambda=1.54\) Å), a first-order reflection occurs at \(2\theta=30^\circ\). The interplanar spacing \(d\) is closest to: (Use Bragg’s law \(n\lambda=2d\sin\theta\)).
A. 1.54 Å  
B. 2.97 Å  
C. 3.08 Å  
D. 5.94 Å  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: X-ray crystallography uses Bragg’s law to relate diffraction angle to lattice plane spacing.
Here \(\theta=15^\circ\) and \(n=1\), so \(d=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\sin\theta}=\dfrac{1.54}{2\sin15^\circ}\approx \dfrac{1.54}{0.518}\approx 2.97\) Å is close, but the more accurate \(\sin 15^\circ \approx 0.2588\) gives \(d\approx 2.98\) Å; however note that \(2\sin15^\circ = 0.5176\), so \(d\approx 2.97\) Å.
The option 3.08 Å corresponds to using \(\theta=14^\circ\) (a common angle-reading error) or rounding inconsistently, whereas 1.54 Å comes from forgetting the factor \(2\sin\theta\).
The largest value arises if \(\sin\theta\) is mistakenly replaced by \(\sin 2\theta\), which is not Bragg’s condition.

***

9) For a monovalent cation-selective electrode at 25°C, the Nernst slope magnitude is approximately 59 mV per decade change in activity. If the measured potential changes by +118 mV when moving from solution 1 to solution 2, the activity ratio \(a_2/a_1\) is closest to:
A. 2  
B. 10  
C. 100  
D. 1000  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Ion-selective electrodes are interpreted using a Nernst-type dependence of potential on logarithm of ion activity.
A change of 59 mV corresponds to a 10-fold change for a monovalent ion, so 118 mV corresponds to two decades, i.e., a factor \(10^2=100\).
Choosing 10 corresponds to treating 118 mV as one decade, which ignores the approximate doubling of the Nernst slope steps.
Choosing 1000 corresponds to assuming 118 mV equals three decades, which would require about 177 mV for a monovalent ion at 25°C.

***

10) In cyclic voltammetry, a one-electron reversible redox couple at 25°C is often identified by a peak-to-peak separation \(\Delta E_p\) close to 59 mV. If an experimental voltammogram shows \(\Delta E_p \approx 120\) mV under otherwise similar conditions, the best interpretation is:
A. The system is more reversible than ideal and electron transfer is faster than diffusion  
B. The system is quasi-reversible or has kinetic limitations relative to an ideal reversible case  
C. The number of electrons transferred must be exactly 2  
D. The redox process cannot be electrochemical because peaks are separated  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: CV interpretation uses features like peak potentials and their separation to assess reversible, quasi-reversible, and irreversible behavior.
A significantly larger \(\Delta E_p\) than the typical reversible benchmark indicates slower electron-transfer kinetics and departure from ideal Nernstian behavior at the electrode surface.
Assigning this directly to a 2-electron process is unreliable because \(\Delta E_p\) also depends on kinetics, uncompensated resistance, and experimental factors, not only electron count.
Peak separation is expected in CV, and the presence of anodic/cathodic peaks is itself consistent with electrochemical redox processes.
