1) In XeOF₄, the oxidation state of xenon is:
A. +4
B. +6
C. +8
D. +2

Correct answer: +6

Explanation: Take F as −1 (four fluorines give −4) and O as −2, so xenon must be +6 to make the molecule neutral.  +4 would not balance the total ligand charge and would leave the molecule overall negative.  +8 is common for XeO₄ but is too high for a species containing four fluorides and one oxide as written.  +2 is inconsistent with xenon oxyfluoride chemistry emphasized alongside higher oxidation states.

2) The number of lone pairs on the central atom in XeF₄, as inferred from its square planar geometry (VSEPR), is:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3

Correct answer: 2

Explanation: A square planar molecular shape for an AX₄E₂ species arises from an octahedral electron-pair arrangement with two lone pairs opposite each other.  With zero lone pairs, an AX₄ species would typically be tetrahedral rather than square planar.  With one lone pair, the expected shape would be a seesaw-type distortion for five electron domains rather than square planar.  Three lone pairs with four bonds would imply seven electron domains, which is not the standard VSEPR count used for XeF₄ in this unit.

3) For IF₅ (square pyramidal), how many distinct fluorine environments are expected in ¹⁹F NMR if the structure is rigid on the NMR timescale?
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 5

Correct answer: 2

Explanation: In a square pyramidal structure, one fluorine is axial while the four basal fluorines are symmetry-equivalent, giving two distinct sets.  A single environment would require all five fluorines to be equivalent, which is not consistent with square pyramidal geometry.  Three environments would imply further inequivalence among basal fluorines, which is not expected for the idealized structure used in VSEPR-based structure determination.  Five environments would require all fluorines to be inequivalent, which would contradict the symmetry implied by square pyramidal geometry.

4) BrF₃ is T-shaped by VSEPR; the number of lone pairs on bromine in BrF₃ is:
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3

Correct answer: 2

Explanation: A T-shaped molecule corresponds to AX₃E₂ with five electron domains (trigonal bipyramidal electron arrangement) and two lone pairs occupying equatorial positions.  With zero lone pairs, three bonds would typically give trigonal planar geometry.  With one lone pair and three bonds, a seesaw geometry is more consistent than a T-shape.  With three lone pairs and three bonds, six electron domains would be implied and the structure would not match the T-shaped description used for XY₃ interhalogens here.

5) Which interhalogen is expected to have the greatest steric effect from lone pairs on the central halogen when comparing BrF₃ (T-shaped), IF₅ (square pyramidal), and IF₇ (pentagonal bipyramidal)?
A. BrF₃
B. IF₅
C. IF₇
D. All have the same lone-pair count

Correct answer: BrF₃

Explanation: BrF₃ (AX₃E₂) has two lone pairs, which strongly influence geometry and bond angles in the VSEPR picture used for interhalogens.  IF₅ (AX₅E) has only one lone pair, so lone-pair effects are present but typically less dominating than with two lone pairs.  IF₇ is commonly treated as having no lone pairs on iodine in the simple VSEPR count for a pentagonal bipyramidal structure.  The lone-pair counts therefore differ across these three species.

6) Using electron-counting logic from VSEPR-based structure determination, which species is most consistent with a square planar geometry among the following?
A. XeF₄
B. IF₇
C. XeF₂
D. IF₅

Correct answer: XeF₄

Explanation: XeF₄ is explicitly associated with square planar geometry and lone-pair-controlled structure in this unit.  IF₇ is associated with pentagonal bipyramidal geometry rather than square planar.  XeF₂ is linear under the VSEPR model used for noble gas fluorides.  IF₅ is square pyramidal, which differs from square planar by having an additional axial bond.

7) The stability trend among xenon fluorides stated in this unit is XeF₂ > XeF₄ > XeF₆; which reasoning best aligns with correlating structure and lone-pair effects?
A. Greater fluorine content increases polarization and makes higher fluorides thermally less stable in the trend given.
B. XeF₆ has no lone pairs, so it is least stable.
C. XeF₂ is least stable because it is hypervalent.
D. XeF₄ is least stable because it is square planar.

Correct answer: Greater fluorine content increases polarization and makes higher fluorides thermally less stable in the trend given.

Explanation: The unit highlights a stability trend and also emphasizes lone-pair-driven distortions and reactivity patterns in xenon fluorides, which qualitatively supports decreasing stability with higher fluorination in that sequence.  XeF₆ is discussed with lone-pair effects and asymmetry, so describing it as having no lone pairs conflicts with the structural discussion.  Hypervalency alone does not make XeF₂ least stable here because XeF₂ is explicitly placed as the most stable in the stated trend.  Square planarity of XeF₄ is a geometry outcome and is not presented as the primary reason it would be least stable compared to XeF₆ in this trend.

8) Consider ICl₄⁻ (a polyinterhalogen ion). The oxidation state of iodine in ICl₄⁻ is:
A. +1
B. +3
C. +5
D. −3

Correct answer: +3

Explanation: Assign each chlorine as −1; four chlorines contribute −4 total, and the overall ion charge is −1, so iodine must be +3 to satisfy charge balance.  +1 would yield an overall charge of −3, not −1.  +5 would yield an overall charge of +1, not −1.  A negative oxidation state on iodine would make the total charge far more negative than −1 for four chloride ligands.

9) SCN⁻ is often described as ambidentate in coordination chemistry; which donor-atom pair best represents this behavior?
A. Sulfur or nitrogen
B. Carbon or oxygen
C. Fluorine or chlorine
D. Oxygen or hydrogen

Correct answer: Sulfur or nitrogen

Explanation: The unit explicitly ties thiocyanate (SCN⁻) to ambidentate behavior and coordination isomerism, which arises from its ability to bind through different atoms.  Binding through sulfur versus nitrogen is the classic ambidentate choice for SCN⁻, consistent with the “ambidentate behavior” section.  Carbon/oxygen binding corresponds more to ions like OCN⁻/NCO⁻ patterns rather than SCN⁻ as emphasized here.  Fluorine/chlorine and oxygen/hydrogen are not the donor-atom options relevant to SCN⁻ ambidentate coordination.

10) Which statement best connects why fluorine forms the largest variety of interhalogen compounds to periodic properties emphasized in this unit?
A. Fluorine’s very high electronegativity and small size favor strong X–F bonding across many partners.
B. Fluorine has the lowest ionization energy among halogens, so it readily becomes F⁺.
C. Fluorine is highly polarizable, so it stabilizes large polyhalide clusters best.
D. Fluorine is metallic in nature, so it forms intermetallic interhalogens easily.

Correct answer: Fluorine’s very high electronegativity and small size favor strong X–F bonding across many partners.

Explanation: The unit includes “Why fluorine forms most interhalogen compounds” under interhalogen classification and ties interhalogen formation to halogen periodic trends.  High electronegativity and small size support strong bonding and stabilization of a wide range of interhalogens relative to other halogen combinations.  Formation of F⁺ is not a standard driver for interhalogen formation trends discussed under halogen fundamentals.  High polarizability is more characteristic of heavier halogens, and describing fluorine as metallic is chemically incorrect for the halogen family context used here.
