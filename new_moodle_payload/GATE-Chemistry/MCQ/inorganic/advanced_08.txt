1) Consider a nucleus that undergoes \(\beta^-\) decay followed by \(\gamma\) emission from an excited state of the daughter nucleus. Which statement about the net changes in \((A,Z)\) and the physical origin of the emitted radiations is most accurate?
A. \(A\) decreases by 4 and \(Z\) decreases by 2; \(\gamma\) emission occurs due to electron transitions  
B. \(A\) remains the same and \(Z\) increases by 1; \(\gamma\) emission corresponds to de-excitation of the nucleus without changing \((A,Z)\)  
C. \(A\) remains the same and \(Z\) decreases by 1; \(\gamma\) emission converts a neutron into a proton  
D. \(A\) increases by 1 and \(Z\) remains the same; \(\gamma\) emission is the emission of a helium nucleus  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In \(\beta^-\) decay, a neutron converts to a proton, so \(A\) stays constant while \(Z\) increases by 1.
\(\gamma\) emission is a nuclear de-excitation process (photon emission) that does not change either \(A\) or \(Z\), but reduces the nuclear energy.
A decrease by 4 in \(A\) and 2 in \(Z\) describes alpha decay, not \(\beta^-\) decay.
A claim that \(\gamma\) emission causes nucleon conversion confuses it with beta processes, while describing \(\gamma\) as an electronic transition confuses nuclear radiation with atomic spectroscopy.

2) A student claims: “A nuclear reaction is exothermic whenever products have larger total mass than reactants, because extra mass becomes energy.” Which correction best aligns with the Q-value concept and mass–energy relation?
A. Exothermic reactions require product mass greater than reactant mass; Q-value is negative  
B. Exothermic reactions require product mass less than reactant mass; Q-value is positive and equals \((m_\text{reactants}-m_\text{products})c^2\)  
C. Exothermicity cannot be inferred from masses because Q-value depends only on half-life  
D. Exothermic reactions require product mass equal to reactant mass; Q-value is always zero  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Q-value represents the energy released (positive) or absorbed (negative) in a nuclear reaction and is determined by the mass difference between reactants and products.
If the products have lower total mass than reactants, the mass defect corresponds to released energy via \(Q=(m_\text{reactants}-m_\text{products})c^2\).
Saying “extra mass becomes energy” reverses the direction: energy release corresponds to a decrease in mass, not an increase.
Half-life governs spontaneous decay kinetics and is not the criterion for whether an arbitrary nuclear reaction is exothermic.

3) Two nuclei are compared for stability reasoning: one has a notably higher binding energy per nucleon than the other. Which inference is most defensible about their relative nuclear stability and tendency toward radioactivity?
A. The nucleus with higher binding energy per nucleon is generally more stable against spontaneous change  
B. The nucleus with higher binding energy per nucleon is necessarily more radioactive because it “contains more energy”  
C. Binding energy per nucleon is unrelated to stability; only detector choice determines apparent stability  
D. Higher binding energy per nucleon guarantees the nucleus must undergo beta decay  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Binding energy reflects how strongly nucleons are held together, so higher binding energy per nucleon generally indicates greater nuclear stability.
Interpreting higher binding energy as “more stored energy that must be released” is a misconception; stronger binding typically means the nucleus is less eager to rearrange spontaneously.
Detector choice affects measurement, not the intrinsic stability of the nucleus.
Decay mode selection (alpha, beta, gamma) depends on specific stability factors and conservation requirements, so no single decay type is guaranteed solely from “higher binding energy per nucleon.”

4) In a fission reactor discussion, which statement best links criticality, the multiplication factor \(k\), and reactor safety considerations without mixing them up with radioactive half-life concepts?
A. Criticality is achieved when half-life of the fuel equals the neutron generation time  
B. A reactor is critical when \(k=1\); safety systems aim to keep the system from becoming supercritical (\(k>1\)) in an uncontrolled manner  
C. A reactor is subcritical when \(k>1\); it then requires shielding to reduce half-life  
D. Criticality is determined only by the Q-value and does not involve neutron economy  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The multiplication factor \(k\) governs whether the neutron population decreases (\(k<1\)), stays steady (\(k=1\)), or increases (\(k>1\)), which directly defines subcritical, critical, and supercritical states.
Reactor control and safety revolve around managing neutron multiplication and chain reactions, not changing the half-life of the fuel.
Q-value describes energy release per reaction, but sustaining a chain reaction depends on neutron production, losses, and the overall neutron economy captured qualitatively by \(k\).

5) Fusion between light nuclei in stars occurs at energies lower than the classical Coulomb barrier would suggest. Which explanation best integrates the Coulomb barrier idea with the mechanism enabling fusion?
A. Fusion proceeds because the Coulomb barrier becomes attractive at long distances  
B. Fusion proceeds because electrons eliminate the Coulomb repulsion completely in stellar cores  
C. Fusion proceeds because quantum tunneling allows nuclei to penetrate the Coulomb barrier with nonzero probability  
D. Fusion proceeds because gamma emission increases the charge of nuclei, reducing repulsion  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: The Coulomb barrier is the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei that must be overcome or penetrated for fusion to occur.
Quantum tunneling provides a finite probability for nuclei to pass through the barrier even when classical kinetic energy is insufficient, enabling fusion under stellar conditions.
The barrier is repulsive (not attractive) at relevant separations until the strong nuclear force dominates at very short range, so long-distance attraction is incorrect.
Electrons can screen repulsion partially but do not remove it completely, and gamma emission does not “increase charge to reduce repulsion” (it does not change \(Z\)).
