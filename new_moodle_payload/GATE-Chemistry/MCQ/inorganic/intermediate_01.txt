Question: 0.50 mol of Mg₃N₂ is completely hydrolyzed with excess water; how many moles of NH₃ are produced?
Options:
- 0.50 mol
- 1.00 mol
- 1.50 mol
- 3.00 mol
Correct answer: 1.00 mol.
Explanation: Ionic nitrides contain the nitride ion (\( \text{N}^{3-} \)) which hydrolyzes to give ammonia, and a common stoichiometry is \( \text{Mg}_3\text{N}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 3\text{Mg(OH)}_2 + 2\text{NH}_3 \).  From the balanced equation, 1 mol of Mg₃N₂ gives 2 mol of NH₃, so 0.50 mol gives \(0.50 \times 2 = 1.00\) mol NH₃.  The other options reflect incorrect mole ratios (assuming 1:1, 3:1, or doubling the product incorrectly).

Question: In the polysulfide Na₂S₄, the average oxidation state of sulfur is:
Options:
- −2
- −1
- −1/2
- 0
Correct answer: −1/2.
Explanation: Polysulfides are included as a sulfide class, and oxidation-state accounting uses charge balance on the anion \( \text{S}_4^{2-} \).  The total charge (−2) spread over 4 sulfur atoms gives an average oxidation state of \( -2/4 = -1/2 \).  −2 corresponds to monosulfide \( \text{S}^{2-} \) (like in Na₂S), 0 corresponds to elemental sulfur, and −1 is a common mistake from confusing \( \text{S}_2^{2-} \) (disulfide) with \( \text{S}_4^{2-} \).

Question: Arrange the oxoacids of chlorine in increasing acid strength using the “more O atoms/higher oxidation state → stronger acid” trend.
Options:
- HClO < HClO₂ < HClO₃ < HClO₄
- HClO₄ < HClO₃ < HClO₂ < HClO
- HClO₂ < HClO < HClO₄ < HClO₃
- HClO₃ < HClO₂ < HClO₄ < HClO
Correct answer: HClO < HClO₂ < HClO₃ < HClO₄.
Explanation: The oxoacid section emphasizes structure–property relationships and that acid strength generally increases with greater electron withdrawal (typically more O atoms and higher oxidation state for the same central atom).  Going from HClO to HClO₄, the conjugate base is increasingly stabilized, so acidity increases in that order.  The reverse order is a common misconception that “more oxygens dilute acidity,” and the mixed orders fail to apply the same-center-atom trend consistently.

Question: Using VSEPR, the shape of ClF₃ is predicted to be:
Options:
- Trigonal planar
- T-shaped
- Tetrahedral
- Square planar
Correct answer: T-shaped.
Explanation: The VSEPR objectives include predicting geometries with lone pairs, and ClF₃ has five electron domains around Cl (3 bonding pairs + 2 lone pairs), corresponding to a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair arrangement.  With two equatorial lone pairs, the molecular geometry becomes T-shaped.  Trigonal planar ignores the two lone pairs, tetrahedral corresponds to 4 electron domains, and square planar is typical of 6 electron domains (octahedral electron arrangement with two lone pairs trans).

Question: For PCl₅, the oxidation state of phosphorus and the VSEPR molecular geometry are respectively:
Options:
- +5 and trigonal bipyramidal
- +3 and trigonal pyramidal
- +5 and square pyramidal
- +4 and tetrahedral
Correct answer: +5 and trigonal bipyramidal.
Explanation: Halide chemistry in the unit stresses oxidation state determination and VSEPR-based structure prediction for main-group halides.  In PCl₅, each Cl is −1 so P must be +5, and with five bonding pairs and no lone pair on the central atom (VSEPR model), the geometry is trigonal bipyramidal.  The +3 option corresponds to PCl₃ (not PCl₅), square pyramidal corresponds to 6 electron domains with one lone pair, and +4/tetrahedral mismatches both stoichiometry and electron-domain count.

Question: Which hydride order best represents increasing thermal stability down Group 15 (E–H bond strength trend)?
Options:
- NH₃ < PH₃ < AsH₃ < SbH₃
- SbH₃ < AsH₃ < PH₃ < NH₃
- PH₃ < NH₃ < SbH₃ < AsH₃
- NH₃ < AsH₃ < PH₃ < SbH₃
Correct answer: SbH₃ < AsH₃ < PH₃ < NH₃.
Explanation: The hydrides module includes thermal stability patterns, which for many p-block hydrides correlate with decreasing E–H bond strength down a group.  As the central atom becomes larger down Group 15, overlap worsens and E–H bonds weaken, so thermal stability decreases down the group, making NH₃ most stable and SbH₃ least stable.  The opposite orders assume “heavier means stronger,” which is a common periodic-trend mistake when bond strength actually drops with poorer orbital overlap.

Question: Complete hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of SiCl₄ (excess water) ultimately produces how many moles of HCl (net)?
Options:
- 0.25 mol
- 0.50 mol
- 1.00 mol
- 2.00 mol
Correct answer: 1.00 mol.
Explanation: The halide section highlights hydrolysis trends of covalent halides, and SiCl₄ is a standard case where water attack leads to replacement of Cl by O/H-containing groups, releasing HCl.  Net stoichiometry is commonly represented as \( \text{SiCl}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{SiO}_2 + 4\text{HCl} \), so 1 mol SiCl₄ gives 4 mol HCl and 0.25 mol gives \(0.25 \times 4 = 1.00\) mol HCl.  The smaller values come from mistakenly using 1:1 or 2:1 replacement instead of four Cl atoms being hydrolyzed.

Question: Which pair correctly matches oxygen species and oxidation state of oxygen?
Options:
- Peroxide: oxygen = −1; Superoxide: oxygen = −1/2
- Peroxide: oxygen = −2; Superoxide: oxygen = −1
- Peroxide: oxygen = −1/2; Superoxide: oxygen = −1
- Peroxide: oxygen = 0; Superoxide: oxygen = −2
Correct answer: Peroxide: oxygen = −1; Superoxide: oxygen = −1/2.
Explanation: The oxides module explicitly includes peroxides and superoxides as distinct oxygen-containing classes.  In peroxides (\(\text{O}_2^{2-}\)), each oxygen is −1 on average, while in superoxides (\(\text{O}_2^{-}\)), each oxygen is −1/2 on average.  The other options confuse these with the oxide ion (\(\text{O}^{2-}\), oxidation state −2) or elemental oxygen (0).

Question: Which compound is most likely to be amphoteric and react with both strong acids and strong bases?
Options:
- Al₂O₃
- Na₂O
- CO₂
- SO₃
Correct answer: Al₂O₃.
Explanation: Oxide classification into acidic, basic, and amphoteric is a core objective in the oxides topic.  Al₂O₃ is amphoteric, whereas Na₂O is mainly basic and CO₂/SO₃ are acidic oxides (acid anhydrides).  A common misconception is to label all metal oxides as purely basic, but certain main-group metal oxides (like aluminum oxide) show amphoteric behavior.

Question: A halide ECl₃ is found to be strongly Lewis acidic and readily hydrolyzed; which central atom choice best fits this behavior based on electron deficiency and bonding trends?
Options:
- B in BCl₃
- Na in “NaCl₃”
- Ne in “NeCl₃”
- Mg in “MgCl₃”
Correct answer: B in BCl₃.
Explanation: The halides topic includes Lewis acidity and hydrolysis mechanisms, and electron-deficient trihalides like BCl₃ are classic Lewis acids due to an incomplete octet at boron.  “NaCl₃,” “NeCl₃,” and “MgCl₃” are not realistic neutral stoichiometries for stable main-group trichlorides in this context, reflecting incorrect oxidation/valency assumptions rather than the intended halide chemistry trend.  The key idea is that covalent, electron-deficient halides tend to be strong Lewis acids and hence hydrolyze readily.
