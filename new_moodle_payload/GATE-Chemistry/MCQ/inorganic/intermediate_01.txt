1) A gaseous main-group halide \(\mathrm{EX_3}\) (E = Group 13 element, X = halogen) shows rapid hydrolysis in moist air. The most consistent explanation is:
A. The central atom behaves as a Lewis acid and is attacked by water, leading to E–X bond cleavage  
B. Hydrolysis is fastest because E–X bonds are nonpolar and cannot resist water  
C. Hydrolysis occurs only if the halide is ionic and forms \(\mathrm{X^-}\) immediately  
D. Hydrolysis is independent of bonding; only the boiling point matters  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Hydrolysis trends in main-group halides are commonly rationalized using Lewis acidity of the halide (electron-deficient E center), enabling nucleophilic attack by water and subsequent cleavage/substitution reactions.
Nonpolar bonds do not generally explain rapid hydrolysis; polar/activated bonds and electrophilic centers are more relevant.
Many hydrolyzing halides are predominantly covalent rather than ionic, so “only ionic halides hydrolyze” is incorrect.
Boiling point may affect exposure/handling but does not control hydrolysis mechanism in the way Lewis acidity and bonding do.

2) A main-group halide has formula \(\mathrm{EX_5}\) and VSEPR is used to predict its molecular shape (considering lone pairs on E). If E has 6 electron pairs around it (5 bonding pairs + 1 lone pair), the expected molecular shape is:
A. Square pyramidal  
B. Trigonal bipyramidal  
C. Octahedral  
D. T-shaped  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Six electron domains correspond to an octahedral electron-pair arrangement; with one lone pair (\(\mathrm{AX_5E}\)), the molecular shape becomes square pyramidal.
Trigonal bipyramidal would correspond to five electron domains, not six.
Octahedral is the electron-domain geometry for six domains, but with a lone pair the molecular shape is not octahedral.
T-shaped corresponds to five electron domains with two lone pairs (\(\mathrm{AX_3E_2}\)).

3) Consider oxoacids of chlorine: \(\mathrm{HClO}\), \(\mathrm{HClO_2}\), \(\mathrm{HClO_3}\), \(\mathrm{HClO_4}\). The correct qualitative order of acid strength is:
A. \(\mathrm{HClO_4 > HClO_3 > HClO_2 > HClO}\)  
B. \(\mathrm{HClO > HClO_2 > HClO_3 > HClO_4}\)  
C. \(\mathrm{HClO_2 > HClO_4 > HClO > HClO_3}\)  
D. All have equal acid strength because chlorine is the same element  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For oxoacids of the same central atom, increasing number of oxygen atoms (and associated higher oxidation state/greater electron withdrawal) generally increases acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base.
The reverse order contradicts the oxygen/oxidation-state factor emphasized for oxoacid acidity trends.
A mixed order that breaks monotonic oxygen dependence is not consistent with the standard trend used for this family.
Even with the same central element, changing the number of oxygen atoms changes structure and conjugate-base stabilization, so strengths are not equal.

4) In an “oxoacid series” of a given element, which factor most directly increases acid strength according to structure–property arguments?
A. Higher oxidation state of the central atom and greater electron-withdrawing effect through oxygen  
B. Larger atomic radius of hydrogen in the O–H bond  
C. Lower electronegativity of oxygen atoms attached to the central atom  
D. Elimination of resonance possibilities in the conjugate base  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Acid strength trends in oxoacids are linked to central-atom oxidation state and electron withdrawal through oxygen, which stabilizes the conjugate base and increases acidity.
Hydrogen atomic radius is not the controlling parameter for acid strength in these comparisons.
Oxygen electronegativity is constant; trends arise from the environment/oxidation state and bonding, not “lower EN of oxygen.”
Resonance stabilization generally strengthens acids by stabilizing conjugate bases, so “eliminating resonance” would not increase acidity.

5) A binary oxide \(\mathrm{EO}\) reacts with both strong acids and strong bases to form salts. Based on oxide classification, \(\mathrm{EO}\) is best classified as:
A. Amphoteric oxide  
B. Acidic oxide  
C. Basic oxide  
D. Neutral oxide  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: An oxide that reacts with both acids and bases is amphoteric by definition, matching the classification scheme for main-group oxides.
Acidic oxides mainly react with bases, while basic oxides mainly react with acids; neither fits “both.”
Neutral oxides show minimal acid–base reactivity, so they do not match the described behavior.

6) A compound \(\mathrm{E_2O_3}\) shows two oxidation states of E in the solid and can vary slightly in composition (non-stoichiometry). This behavior is most closely associated with:
A. Mixed-valence / non-stoichiometric oxides  
B. Only purely molecular oxides with fixed stoichiometry  
C. Oxoacids with extensive hydrogen bonding  
D. Halides undergoing hydrolysis  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The oxide section explicitly highlights mixed-valence and non-stoichiometric oxides as a category, consistent with variable composition and multiple oxidation states in solids.
Purely molecular oxides typically have well-defined stoichiometry and do not show non-stoichiometric lattice behavior in the same way.
Oxoacids are different compound classes (contain H and O in acid structures), not binary oxides.
Halide hydrolysis is unrelated to mixed-valence oxide non-stoichiometry.

7) A hydride \(\mathrm{EH_4}\) of a Group 14 element is compared to \(\mathrm{EH_3}\) of a Group 15 element (same period). Which comparison is most consistent with hydride classification and bonding ideas?
A. Both are primarily covalent hydrides, but their geometry predictions differ because electron-domain counts differ  
B. Both are ionic hydrides because hydrogen is always \(\mathrm{H^-}\) in hydrides  
C. Both must contain bridge hydrogens because p-block hydrides are always electron-deficient  
D. Both are metallic hydrides because E is a main-group element  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Many p-block hydrides such as Group 14 tetrahydrides and Group 15 trihydrides are treated as covalent hydrides; however, VSEPR predicts different shapes due to different numbers of bonding pairs and lone pairs.
Hydrogen is not always present as \(\mathrm{H^-}\); ionic hydrides are a specific class typically associated with highly electropositive metals.
Bridge hydrides and electron-deficient bonding apply to specific systems (not “all p-block hydrides”).
Metallic hydrides are again a distinct class and are not implied merely because E is main-group.

8) A nitride is classified as ionic rather than covalent/network if its dominant anionic unit is best described as:
A. \(\mathrm{N^{3-}}\) with strong basic character and hydrolysis tendency  
B. Neutral \(\mathrm{N_2}\) molecules trapped in a lattice  
C. A polymeric \(\mathrm{(EN)_n}\) network with extensive covalent bonding  
D. A cationic nitrogen center \(\mathrm{N^+}\) bonded to metals  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Ionic nitrides are described using \(\mathrm{N^{3-}}\) and show characteristic reactivity such as hydrolysis, aligning with the nitride classification and “\(\mathrm{N^{3-}}\) ion reactivity” focus.
Neutral \(\mathrm{N_2}\) trapped is not the defining feature of ionic nitrides.
Polymeric network structures are characteristic of covalent/network nitrides (e.g., BN, Si\(_3\)N\(_4\)-type descriptions), not ionic nitrides.
\(\mathrm{N^+}\) centers are not the standard description used for classifying ionic nitrides in main-group binary nitride chemistry.

9) A sulfide sample contains \(\mathrm{S^{2-}}\) and also shows S–S bonding leading to higher sulfur aggregation. This is most consistent with the presence of:
A. Polysulfides (and/or mixed-valence sulfides)  
B. Only simple ionic sulfides with fixed \(\mathrm{S^{2-}}\) and no S–S bonds  
C. Oxides formed by complete oxidation of sulfur  
D. Only hydrogen sulfide as the sulfide representative  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The sulfide section explicitly includes polysulfides and mixed-valence sulfides, where S–S bonding and multiple sulfur units are expected structural features.
Simple ionic sulfides are typically described by \(\mathrm{S^{2-}}\) without invoking S–S bonds; the presence of S–S bonding indicates different speciation.
Oxides represent an oxidized class (O-containing), not S–S aggregated sulfide chemistry.
Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent molecular sulfide, not the general descriptor for S–S aggregation in inorganic sulfide solids/salts.

10) An unknown binary compound of a p-block element reacts vigorously with water to give a basic solution and hydrogen gas, and the bonding is inferred to involve \(\mathrm{H^-}\). Which classification is most appropriate?
A. Ionic hydride  
B. Covalent hydride  
C. Oxoacid  
D. Amphoteric oxide  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Ionic hydrides contain hydride ion \(\mathrm{H^-}\) and are strongly basic/reactive toward water, often producing hydrogen gas and hydroxide, fitting the classification and reactivity patterns for hydrides.
Covalent hydrides do not generally behave as salts containing \(\mathrm{H^-}\) and typically do not generate strongly basic solutions in this manner.
Oxoacids contain oxygen and acidic hydrogen; they would not produce a basic solution by reacting with water as described.
Amphoteric oxides involve oxygen and acid–base amphoterism, not hydride-ion chemistry.
