1) The high chemical inertness of noble gases is most directly attributed to:
A. A filled valence shell and high ionization energy in general
B. Very high electron affinity values across the group
C. Very low electronegativity leading to easy oxidation
D. Presence of vacant d-orbitals that strongly attract electrons

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Noble gases have closed-shell electronic configurations, so there is little driving force to form bonds under ordinary conditions.  High ionization energy makes electron removal difficult, reinforcing inertness.  High electron affinity is not characteristic of noble gases, so it does not explain their behavior.  Low electronegativity does not imply easy oxidation for closed-shell atoms, and vacant d-orbitals are not the key reason for inertness.

2) Xenon forms stable compounds more readily than lighter noble gases primarily because xenon has:
A. Lower ionization energy and larger, more polarizable electron cloud
B. A completely empty valence shell
C. The highest electronegativity among noble gases
D. A natural tendency to exist as Xe²⁻ in solids

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Down Group 18, atomic size increases and ionization energy generally decreases, making xenon comparatively more reactive.  Greater polarizability and accessible oxidation states help xenon interact with very electronegative elements like fluorine.  Xenon does not have an empty valence shell, and noble gases do not typically form stable anions like Xe²⁻ under normal chemistry.  Xenon is not described as having the highest electronegativity; the key driver emphasized is ionization energy and related trends.

3) The first widely recognized noble-gas compound that initiated modern noble-gas chemistry was:
A. XePtF₆
B. XeO₄
C. KrF₂
D. IF₇

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The first synthesis highlighted in the learning path is XePtF₆, marking the breakthrough that noble gases can form compounds.  Xenon oxides (like XeO₄) and krypton difluoride (KrF₂) are discussed as later or additional noble-gas compounds, not the initial landmark discovery.  IF₇ is an interhalogen compound and is not a noble-gas compound.

4) Using VSEPR theory, the molecular geometry of XeF₂ is predicted to be:
A. Linear
B. Trigonal planar
C. T-shaped
D. Square planar

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: XeF₂ is treated as having five electron pairs around xenon (two bonding pairs and three lone pairs), giving a trigonal-bipyramidal electron-pair arrangement.  Lone pairs occupy equatorial positions, leaving the two Xe–F bonds axial and producing a linear molecular shape.  Trigonal planar would require three bonding regions and no appropriate lone-pair arrangement for XeF₂ as presented here.  T-shaped and square planar correspond to different electron-pair counts/arrangements than XeF₂ in the learning path.

5) The bonding in XeF₂ is best described by which model?
A. Three-center four-electron (3c–4e) bonding
B. Purely ionic bonding: Xe²⁺ and 2F⁻
C. A localized Xe=F double bond framework
D. A hydrogen-bonded polymeric chain model

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: XeF₂ is specifically associated with a three-center four-electron (3c–4e) bonding description in the learning path.  A fully ionic Xe²⁺ formulation is not the bonding model emphasized for xenon fluorides.  Localized Xe=F double bonds are not the standard description for XeF₂ bonding in this context.  Hydrogen bonding is irrelevant here because the compound contains no hydrogen and its key feature is hypervalent bonding.

6) The geometry of XeF₄ is:
A. Square planar
B. Tetrahedral
C. Trigonal bipyramidal
D. Seesaw

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: XeF₄ is described as square planar, consistent with VSEPR treatment where lone pairs influence geometry.  Tetrahedral would require four bonding pairs and no lone-pair arrangement that matches XeF₄ as discussed.  Trigonal bipyramidal and seesaw shapes correspond to five electron domains and different lone-pair distributions than the XeF₄ case in the syllabus outline.

7) XeF₆ is best described as having which molecular geometry (typical description emphasized)?
A. Distorted octahedral (asymmetric due to lone-pair effects)
B. Perfect octahedral (fully symmetric)
C. Trigonal planar
D. Linear

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: XeF₆ is highlighted as having a distorted octahedral structure, with asymmetry attributed to lone-pair effects.  A perfectly symmetric octahedral structure is not the emphasized description for XeF₆ here.  Trigonal planar and linear geometries correspond to far fewer electron domains than present in XeF₆.

8) The molecular geometry of IF₇ is:
A. Pentagonal bipyramidal
B. Square planar
C. T-shaped
D. Tetrahedral

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: IF₇ is presented under XY₇ interhalogens and is associated with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry by VSEPR considerations.  Square planar is typical for certain 4-coordinate species (including some polyinterhalogen ions) rather than a 7-coordinate neutral interhalogen.  T-shaped corresponds to many XY₃ interhalogens like BrF₃, not IF₇.  Tetrahedral is characteristic of 4 electron domains, which does not apply to IF₇.

9) Which of the following is a common pseudohalogen (pseudohalide) ion discussed in this unit?
A. CN⁻
B. OH⁻
C. NO₃⁻
D. CO₃²⁻

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: CN⁻ is explicitly listed among common pseudohalogens/pseudohalides (along with SCN⁻, N₃⁻, OCN⁻, SeCN⁻).  Hydroxide, nitrate, and carbonate are not classified as pseudohalogens in the provided concept list.  The pseudohalogen idea here centers on halide-like behavior, which is specifically attributed to ions like CN⁻ and SCN⁻ in the unit.

10) The geometry of the polyinterhalogen ion BrF₄⁻ is:
A. Square planar
B. Tetrahedral
C. Trigonal planar
D. Linear

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: BrF₄⁻ is listed among polyinterhalogen ions and is associated with square planar geometry in the unit’s polyinterhalogen section.  Tetrahedral would correspond to four bonding regions with no strong lone-pair-driven planarity as emphasized for these ions.  Trigonal planar and linear geometries do not match a four-fluoride coordination environment for BrF₄⁻ as presented.
