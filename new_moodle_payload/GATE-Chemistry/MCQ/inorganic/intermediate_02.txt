1) Using Wade’s rules, the closo borane anion \(\mathrm{[B_6H_6]^{2-}}\) should have how many skeletal electron pairs (SEPs)?
A. 5  
B. 6  
C. 7  
D. 8  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: For a closo cluster with \(n\) vertices, Wade’s rule predicts SEPs \(= n+1\).  Here \(n=6\), so SEPs \(=7\) would be wrong; the correct value is \(6+1=7\) only if using a different electron-pair counting convention, but Wade’s standard SEP count for closo is \(n+1\), giving 7; however for boranes it is typically expressed as skeletal electron pairs required = \(n+1\), so \(\mathrm{B_6}\) closo requires 7 SEPs, not 6.  Therefore, among the options, the closest consistent choice is 7.
(Options 5, 6, 8 correspond to nido/arachno-like deviations or miscounting of skeletal pairs.)

2) A borane cluster is identified as **nido** with 6 boron vertices. According to Wade’s rules, the required number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs) is:
A. 7  
B. 8  
C. 9  
D. 10  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Wade’s rules relate skeletal type to electron-pair count, with nido clusters requiring one more SEP than the corresponding closo framework.  For \(n=6\), closo requires \(n+1=7\) SEPs, so nido requires \(n+2=8\) SEPs.  The other answers arise from treating it as arachno (\(n+3\)) or from incorrect mapping of “missing vertices” to electron pairs.

3) A borane shows both terminal and bridging hydrogens in its bonding description. If a hydrogen is **bridging**, it most directly implies:
A. The hydrogen is part of a 3-center–2-electron bond  
B. The hydrogen is present as hydride ion \(\mathrm{H^-}\) bonded ionically  
C. The hydrogen participates in hydrogen bonding with another borane molecule  
D. The hydrogen forms a classical B=H double bond  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Bridging hydrogens in boranes are characteristic of electron-deficient bonding and are described using 3c–2e bonds.  Treating the bridge as ionic \(\mathrm{H^-}\) or as hydrogen bonding does not explain the electron-deficient stabilization central to boranes.  A localized B=H double bond is not the bonding model used for bridge hydrogens in boranes.

4) The three isomers of \(\mathrm{C_2B_{10}H_{12}}\) carborane (ortho, meta, para) differ primarily in:
A. Total number of atoms in the cage  
B. Positions of the two carbon atoms within the cluster framework  
C. Oxidation state of boron changing from +3 to +5  
D. Presence or absence of silicon substitution  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Ortho/meta/para carboranes are structural isomers distinguished by where the carbon atoms are located in the icosahedral cage.  The cage atom count is the same for all isomers, and silicon substitution is not what defines these three forms.  Changing boron oxidation state is not the defining feature of these carborane positional isomers.

5) A silicone is produced by hydrolysis and condensation of chlorosilanes to form an Si–O backbone. The immediate small-molecule byproduct expected in the hydrolysis step is:
A. \(\mathrm{H_2}\)  
B. \(\mathrm{HCl}\)  
C. \(\mathrm{Cl_2}\)  
D. \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Silicone production commonly involves hydrolysis of chlorosilanes followed by condensation to form Si–O–Si linkages.  Hydrolysis of Si–Cl bonds generates silanols and releases \(\mathrm{HCl}\) as byproduct.  \(\mathrm{H_2}\), \(\mathrm{Cl_2}\), and \(\mathrm{CO_2}\) are not the characteristic direct hydrolysis byproducts of chlorosilanes in this route.

6) A silicate anion contains **isolated** \(\mathrm{SiO_4}\) tetrahedra (no shared oxygens). The basic structural class is:
A. Nesosilicate  
B. Inosilicate  
C. Phyllosilicate  
D. Tectosilicate  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Silicates are classified by the polymerization (connectivity) of \(\mathrm{SiO_4}\) tetrahedra.  Isolated tetrahedra correspond to nesosilicates, whereas chains, sheets, and frameworks correspond to ino-, phyllo-, and tecto-silicates.  The distractors reflect common confusion between “polymerization degree” categories.

7) A silicate consists of **single infinite chains** of \(\mathrm{SiO_4}\) tetrahedra. This corresponds to:
A. Sorosilicate  
B. Cyclosilicate  
C. Inosilicate  
D. Nesosilicate  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Chain silicates (such as pyroxene-type frameworks) are classified as inosilicates in the polymerization-based scheme.  Sorosilicates are based on paired tetrahedra, cyclosilicates are rings, and nesosilicates are isolated tetrahedra.  The key discriminant is how many oxygens are shared and whether the connectivity propagates as chains, rings, sheets, or frameworks.

8) A material is described as a BN polymorph that is structurally analogous to diamond. Which BN form is most consistent with this description?
A. Hexagonal BN (h-BN)  
B. Cubic BN (c-BN)  
C. BN in a borazine ring  
D. BN only as an amorphous powder (no polymorph)  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: BN exhibits polymorphism, and c-BN is the form commonly compared to diamond by structural analogy, while h-BN is compared to graphite due to its layered structure.  A borazine ring is a molecular ring compound rather than a bulk BN polymorph.  “Amorphous powder only” ignores the explicit polymorph forms highlighted for BN.

9) In phosphazenes, the key bonding description often discussed is:
A. Only localized single P–N bonds with no delocalization  
B. P–N σ and π bonding with resonance/delocalization contributions  
C. Purely ionic bonding between \(\mathrm{P^{3+}}\) and \(\mathrm{N^{3-}}\)  
D. Hydrogen-bonded networks between \(\mathrm{P-H}\) and \(\mathrm{N-H}\) groups  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Phosphazenes are treated as P–N ring/chain (and sometimes cage) systems where bonding discussions include σ/π components and resonance/delocalization.  A purely ionic picture misses the bonding-mode emphasis used for phosphazenes in this unit.  Extensive hydrogen bonding is not the defining bonding model for phosphazenes compared to the P–N framework description.

10) In industrial synthesis, increasing pressure is generally a key lever for improving equilibrium yield in which process among the following?
A. Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis  
B. Contact process (SO₃ formation step)  
C. Chlor–alkali process  
D. Phosphoric acid manufacture (wet process)  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: The unit explicitly highlights industrial synthesis and process optimization via reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalysts), and ammonia synthesis via Haber–Bosch is a canonical example where pressure is a major equilibrium lever.  The chlor–alkali process is fundamentally electrolytic rather than an equilibrium-pressure optimization case.  Contact process optimization focuses strongly on catalysts and temperature control, while wet phosphoric acid manufacture is dominated by process chemistry and separations rather than pressure-driven equilibrium yield.
