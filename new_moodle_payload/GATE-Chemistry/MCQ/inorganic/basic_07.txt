1) The 18-electron rule in organometallic chemistry is best stated as:
A. Complexes are most stable when the metal valence shell has 18 electrons (metal + ligand donation), similar in spirit to the octet rule
B. Complexes are most stable when the metal oxidation state is +18
C. Complexes are most stable only when the metal has 18 d-electrons
D. Complexes are most stable when there are exactly 18 ligands around the metal

Correct answer: A

Explanation: The 18-electron rule is an electron-counting stability guideline stating that many stable transition-metal organometallic complexes achieve a total of 18 valence electrons at the metal center (metal electrons plus electrons donated by ligands).  The +18 oxidation state idea is not chemically meaningful for these systems, and “18 d-electrons” confuses total valence electron count with only d-electrons.  Stability is not determined by having 18 ligands; typical complexes have far fewer ligands and still satisfy (or violate) the 18-electron guideline depending on electron donation.

2) The total valence electron count at Fe in Fe(CO)5 (neutral/covalent counting) is:
A. 16
B. 18
C. 20
D. 14

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In neutral counting, Fe contributes 8 valence electrons (group 8 metal), and each CO donates 2 electrons as an L-type ligand, so \(8 + 5\times 2 = 18\).  Getting 16 usually comes from forgetting one CO donation or using an inconsistent counting method.  Getting 20 typically results from double-counting ligand donation or incorrectly treating CO as a 4-electron donor.  Getting 14 is a larger undercount that does not match the standard electron-counting approach for metal carbonyls.

3) Stronger metal-to-CO π backbonding in a metal carbonyl typically causes the CO stretching frequency in IR to:
A. Increase, because the C–O bond becomes stronger
B. Decrease, because the C–O bond order is reduced
C. Remain unchanged, because CO is a “spectator” ligand
D. Disappear completely, because CO becomes IR-inactive

Correct answer: B

Explanation: π backbonding involves donation of electron density from metal dπ orbitals into the π* orbitals of CO, which weakens the internal C–O bond and lowers the IR stretching frequency.  An increase in frequency would correspond to a stronger C–O bond, which is opposite to the effect of enhanced π backbonding.  CO is not a spectator in metal carbonyls because backbonding strongly affects bonding and spectroscopy, and the CO stretch does not vanish simply due to coordination.

4) In organometallic notation, η5 (eta-five) hapticity for a cyclopentadienyl ligand most directly means:
A. The ligand binds through five contiguous atoms to the metal center
B. The ligand donates five lone pairs to the metal center
C. The ligand forms five separate sigma bonds from five different ligands
D. The ligand forces the metal to have oxidation state +5

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Hapticity (ηn) describes how many atoms of a π-bonded ligand are simultaneously coordinated to the metal, and η5 indicates coordination through five atoms (as in the Cp ring of metallocenes).  It does not mean donation of five lone pairs, nor does it describe five different ligands making sigma bonds.  Hapticity notation is not an oxidation-state label and does not fix the metal oxidation state to a particular value.

5) The Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model for metal–olefin bonding emphasizes which combination of interactions?
A. σ donation from olefin to metal and π backdonation from metal to olefin π*
B. Purely ionic attraction between a positively charged metal and a negatively charged olefin
C. Only π donation from olefin to metal with no backbonding component
D. Only σ donation from metal to olefin with no donation from the olefin

Correct answer: A

Explanation: In the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson description, an alkene donates electron density from its filled π orbital to the metal (σ-type interaction) and the metal can backdonate from d orbitals into the alkene π* orbital (π backbonding), stabilizing the complex.  A purely ionic picture misses the key donor–acceptor orbital interactions used to explain bonding and reactivity in metal–olefin complexes.  Omitting either the donation or backdonation half of the model gives an incomplete bonding description for many metal–olefin systems.

6) An alkyl ligand that is intrinsically incapable of undergoing β-hydride elimination (for structural reasons) is:
A. M–CH3 (metal–methyl)
B. M–CH2CH3 (metal–ethyl)
C. M–CH(CH3)2 (metal–isopropyl)
D. M–C(CH3)3 (metal–tert-butyl)

Correct answer: A

Explanation: β-hydride elimination requires at least one hydrogen on the β-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the metal-bound carbon), but a methyl group has no β-carbon at all, so the process cannot occur.  Ethyl and isopropyl have β-hydrogens available, so β-hydride elimination is possible in principle.  tert-Butyl has β-carbons (the methyl groups) bearing hydrogens, so it is not intrinsically forbidden by “no β-H,” even though steric and geometric factors may affect feasibility in real complexes.

7) A key characteristic more typical of Fischer-type metal carbenes (rather than Schrock-type) is:
A. Carbene carbon is electrophilic, commonly stabilized by heteroatom substituents, and associated with relatively low-valent metals
B. Carbene carbon is strongly nucleophilic, typically on early high-valent metals, and lacks π-acceptor stabilization
C. The complex must always be a metallocene (Cp2M)
D. The carbene carbon is always a free singlet carbene not bonded to a metal

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Fischer carbenes are commonly described as having an electrophilic carbene carbon and are often associated with features consistent with lower-valent, π-backbonding-capable metals and stabilizing substituents.  The nucleophilic-carbene, early-metal, high-oxidation-state description aligns with Schrock-type carbenes rather than Fischer-type.  Being a metallocene is not required for carbene chemistry, and a metal carbene is defined by a metal–carbon multiple-bond interaction rather than a free (unbound) carbene.

8) Fluxionality in organometallic complexes is most directly evidenced (and quantified) by:
A. Variable-temperature NMR showing signal coalescence due to rapid intramolecular rearrangements
B. Only UV–Vis spectroscopy showing color change with time
C. Only mass spectrometry showing different isotopic patterns
D. Only elemental analysis showing changing percent composition

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Fluxionality refers to rapid intramolecular rearrangements that can average distinct environments on the NMR timescale, and variable-temperature NMR can show coalescence and allow extraction of kinetic information.  UV–Vis may change for many unrelated reasons and does not uniquely diagnose fluxional averaging of nuclear environments.  Mass spectrometry and elemental analysis do not track rapid, reversible intramolecular rearrangements in solution on the relevant timescale.

9) In an oxidative addition step at a transition-metal center, the most typical changes are:
A. Increase in metal oxidation state and increase in coordination number
B. Decrease in metal oxidation state and decrease in coordination number
C. No change in oxidation state, but coordination number increases by 4
D. Oxidation state increases, but coordination number must decrease

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Oxidative addition adds fragments (often two new ligands derived from one substrate) to the metal, commonly increasing the metal oxidation state and increasing the coordination number.  A simultaneous decrease in oxidation state and coordination number corresponds more to reductive elimination than oxidative addition.  The coordination number change is not inherently “+4,” and decreasing coordination number contradicts the defining feature of adding groups to the metal center in oxidative addition.

10) A typical Ziegler–Natta catalyst system for alkene polymerization uses:
A. TiCl4 with an organoaluminum cocatalyst such as AlEt3
B. PdCl2 with CuCl as reoxidant
C. RhCl(PPh3)3 with H2
D. Fe(CO)5 with excess CO

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Ziegler–Natta polymerization commonly uses a titanium halide (such as TiCl4) together with an alkylaluminum cocatalyst to generate active sites for stereospecific alkene insertion.  The PdCl2/CuCl2-type system is characteristic of olefin oxidation chemistry rather than Ziegler–Natta polymerization.  RhCl(PPh3)3 is best known as a homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst, and Fe(CO)5 is a metal carbonyl not used as the standard Ziegler–Natta catalyst pair.
