MCQ: Which statement best classifies NaH?
- An ionic (saline) hydride
- A covalent (molecular) hydride
- A metallic (interstitial) hydride
- A bridge (electron-deficient) hydride
Correct answer: An ionic (saline) hydride.
Explanation: Alkali-metal hydrides like NaH are classified as ionic (saline) hydrides because they are best described as containing \( \text{Na}^+ \) and \( \text{H}^- \).  Covalent hydrides are typical of many p-block nonmetals (discrete molecules), metallic hydrides involve metals with hydrogen in interstitial sites, and bridge hydrides refer to electron-deficient bonding (common in boranes).

MCQ: Diborane (\(\text{B}_2\text{H}_6\)) is best known for containing which type of bonding feature?
- Three-center two-electron (bridge) bonds
- Only conventional two-center two-electron B–H bonds
- Predominantly ionic B–H interactions
- Interstitial hydrogen in a metallic lattice
Correct answer: Three-center two-electron (bridge) bonds.
Explanation: Diborane is the standard example of an electron-deficient hydride with bridge hydrogens forming multicenter bonding (often described as 3-center–2-electron bonds).  “Only conventional 2-center–2-electron bonds” misses the electron-deficient nature, “ionic” is inappropriate for boranes, and “interstitial hydrogen” describes metallic hydrides rather than molecular boranes.

MCQ: Using VSEPR, the molecular shape of \(\text{NH}_3\) is predicted to be:
- Trigonal pyramidal
- Trigonal planar
- Tetrahedral
- Linear
Correct answer: Trigonal pyramidal.
Explanation: VSEPR predicts a trigonal pyramidal shape for \(\text{NH}_3\) because there are four electron domains around N (3 bonding pairs + 1 lone pair), giving a tetrahedral electron-pair arrangement but a pyramidal molecular geometry.  Trigonal planar would require three electron domains and no lone pair, tetrahedral is the electron-pair geometry (not the molecular shape here), and linear corresponds to two electron domains.

MCQ: Which set correctly matches oxide type with a typical example?
- Amphoteric oxide: \(\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3\)
- Acidic oxide: \(\text{MgO}\)
- Basic oxide: \(\text{CO}_2\)
- Neutral oxide: \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\)
Correct answer: Amphoteric oxide: \(\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3\).
Explanation: \(\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3\) is classically amphoteric, showing both acidic and basic behavior depending on the reagent.  \(\text{MgO}\) and \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\) are typically basic oxides, while \(\text{CO}_2\) is an acidic oxide; calling \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\) “neutral” is incorrect in acid–base classification of oxides.

MCQ: Which species corresponds to the peroxide ion present in peroxides?
- \(\text{O}_2^{2-}\)
- \(\text{O}_2^{-}\)
- \(\text{O}^{2-}\)
- \(\text{O}_3^{-}\)
Correct answer: \(\text{O}_2^{2-}\).
Explanation: Peroxides contain the peroxide ion \(\text{O}_2^{2-}\), characterized by an O–O bond and overall −2 charge on the diatomic unit.  \(\text{O}_2^{-}\) is the superoxide ion, \(\text{O}^{2-}\) is the oxide ion (no O–O bond), and \(\text{O}_3^{-}\) is not the peroxide ion and would correspond to a different oxygen species.

MCQ: Which statement best explains why many covalent halides undergo hydrolysis readily?
- The central atom often acts as a Lewis acid and is attacked by water
- Halide ions oxidize water strongly under mild conditions
- Hydrolysis happens only for ionic halides in water
- Hydrolysis is driven mainly by formation of hydrogen gas
Correct answer: The central atom often acts as a Lewis acid and is attacked by water.
Explanation: Many main-group covalent halides are electrophilic (Lewis acidic) at the central atom, so water can attack and cleave M–X (or E–X) bonds, leading to hydrolysis products.  “Halide ions oxidize water” is not the general hydrolysis reason, ionic halides typically dissolve rather than hydrolyze strongly in this sense, and hydrogen gas formation is not the main driving feature for typical halide hydrolysis.

MCQ: In oxoacids of the same central atom, acid strength generally increases with:
- Increasing number of oxygen atoms attached to the central atom
- Decreasing oxidation state of the central atom
- Replacing oxygen atoms by sulfur atoms (keeping formula size same)
- Eliminating all resonance possibilities
Correct answer: Increasing number of oxygen atoms attached to the central atom.
Explanation: For oxoacids of a given element, adding more oxygen atoms typically increases electron withdrawal and stabilizes the conjugate base, increasing acidity (lower pKa).  Lower oxidation state often weakens acidity for the same central atom, sulfur substitution changes bonding/size and does not represent the standard “same-element oxoacid trend,” and removing resonance would generally destabilize conjugate bases rather than strengthen the acid.

MCQ: Which product is commonly formed when an ionic nitride reacts with water?
- Ammonia (\(\text{NH}_3\))
- Nitric acid (\(\text{HNO}_3\))
- Nitrogen dioxide (\(\text{NO}_2\))
- Hydrazine (\(\text{N}_2\text{H}_4\))
Correct answer: Ammonia (\(\text{NH}_3\)).
Explanation: Ionic nitrides contain the nitride ion (\(\text{N}^{3-}\)), which is strongly basic and hydrolyzes in water to give ammonia.  \(\text{HNO}_3\) and \(\text{NO}_2\) are oxidized nitrogen products, not typical hydrolysis products of \(\text{N}^{3-}\), and hydrazine is not the usual direct product of simple ionic nitride hydrolysis.

MCQ: Which choice best describes how periodic trends influence bonding character in main-group binary compounds?
- Lower electronegativity difference tends to increase covalent character
- Higher ionization energy always guarantees ionic bonding
- Larger atomic size always increases acidity of oxides
- Electron affinity has no effect on compound stability
Correct answer: Lower electronegativity difference tends to increase covalent character.
Explanation: Bond polarity and ionic vs covalent character correlate strongly with electronegativity differences, so smaller differences generally mean more covalent bonding.  High ionization energy does not automatically imply ionic bonding, oxide acidity/basicity depends on multiple factors (including electronegativity and oxidation state), and electron affinity can influence stability/reactivity trends, so saying it has “no effect” is incorrect.

MCQ: Which statement best fits the general redox behavior trend discussed for main-group compound chemistry?
- Mixed-valence or non-stoichiometric oxides can be associated with redox flexibility
- All oxides of main-group elements are strictly non-redox in nature
- Disproportionation reactions are impossible for main-group halides
- Sulfides cannot participate in oxidation to oxides or oxoacids
Correct answer: Mixed-valence or non-stoichiometric oxides can be associated with redox flexibility.
Explanation: The learning scope highlights mixed-valence/non-stoichiometric oxides and redox/disproportionation ideas as part of understanding oxide behavior, reflecting that some compositions allow variable oxidation states and redox activity.  Declaring all oxides “strictly non-redox” is too absolute, disproportionation is included as a relevant reactivity concept for halides/oxides, and sulfides can be oxidized further (including toward oxides/oxoacid-related products) under suitable conditions.
