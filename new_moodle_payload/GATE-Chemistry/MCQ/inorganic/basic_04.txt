1) Which statement best defines a Brønsted–Lowry acid?
A. Proton donor  
B. Electron pair donor  
C. Electron pair acceptor  
D. Oxide ion acceptor  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In the Brønsted–Lowry concept, an acid is defined by its ability to donate a proton (H⁺) to another species, forming its conjugate base.
Electron-pair donor/acceptor definitions belong to Lewis theory, and oxide-ion transfer is not the defining criterion for Brønsted–Lowry acidity.

2) In the Brønsted–Lowry framework, what is the conjugate base of H₂SO₄ after donating one proton?
A. SO₄²⁻  
B. HSO₄⁻  
C. H₃SO₄⁺  
D. H₂SO₃  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A conjugate base is formed by removal of one proton from the acid, so loss of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ gives HSO₄⁻.
SO₄²⁻ requires loss of two protons, H₃SO₄⁺ would result from proton gain, and H₂SO₃ is a different acid with different composition.

3) Which pair represents a conjugate acid–base pair?
A. H₃O⁺ / H₂O  
B. H₂O / OH⁻ / O²⁻ (all three together)  
C. Na⁺ / Na  
D. HCl / ClO₄⁻  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Conjugate acid–base pairs differ by exactly one proton (H⁺), so H₃O⁺ and H₂O are conjugates.
Sets involving more than one proton difference, redox-related pairs, or unrelated acids/bases do not satisfy the conjugate-pair definition.

4) Which statement correctly describes the autoionization of water?
A. Water produces H₃O⁺ and OH⁻ by self-ionization.  
B. Water produces H⁺ and O²⁻ in significant concentration.  
C. Water cannot act as an acid or base.  
D. Water ionizes only in the presence of a strong acid.  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Water is amphoteric and undergoes autoionization to generate hydronium (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻), which underlies \(K_w\) and pH concepts.
Formation of free O²⁻ is not the normal aqueous equilibrium, amphoterism contradicts “cannot act,” and self-ionization does not require added acid.

5) At 25°C in aqueous solution, which relationship is consistent with the definitions of pH, pOH, and pKw?
A. pH + pOH = pKw  
B. pH − pOH = pKw  
C. pH × pOH = pKw  
D. pH + pKw = pOH  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The definitions based on water autoionization lead to the relationship pH + pOH = pKw in water (commonly pKw = 14 at 25°C).
The other expressions misuse the defined logarithmic relationships between \(K_w\), \([H^+]\), and \([OH^-]\).

6) Which statement best defines a Lewis acid?
A. Electron pair acceptor  
B. Proton acceptor  
C. Proton donor  
D. Species that increases [H⁺] only in water  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Lewis theory defines acids as electron-pair acceptors and bases as electron-pair donors, allowing analysis beyond proton-transfer reactions.
Proton donor/acceptor descriptions correspond to Brønsted–Lowry, and “in water only” reflects the limited scope associated with Arrhenius-type thinking.

7) The reaction BF₃ + NH₃ → F₃B–NH₃ is best classified as:
A. Lewis acid–base adduct formation  
B. Brønsted acid–base neutralization producing water  
C. Redox reaction with electron transfer from B to N  
D. Precipitation reaction driven by low solubility  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: BF₃ accepts an electron pair from NH₃ to form a coordinate bond, so the product is a Lewis adduct formed by Lewis acid–base interaction.
No proton transfer to form water occurs, the key step is electron-pair donation rather than a redox electron-transfer process, and there is no precipitation criterion involved.

8) Which species is amphoteric (can act as both acid and base) under Brønsted–Lowry ideas?
A. H₂O  
B. Na⁺  
C. Cl⁻  
D. CH₄  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Amphoteric species can donate or accept a proton, and water is a central example because it can form H₃O⁺ (as a base) or OH⁻ (as an acid).
Ions like Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are not generally amphiprotic in water, and methane lacks the typical tendency to donate or accept H⁺ under ordinary acid–base conditions.

9) Which statement correctly relates the strengths of a conjugate acid–base pair in water?
A. A stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base.  
B. A stronger acid has a stronger conjugate base.  
C. Acid strength and conjugate base strength are independent.  
D. Conjugate base strength increases with lower Ka of the acid.  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Brønsted–Lowry conjugate pairs show an inverse relationship: greater acid ionization (stronger acid) corresponds to a conjugate base that is less able to accept a proton.
Treating both as simultaneously strong or independent conflicts with the conjugate-pair equilibrium viewpoint used in acid–base equilibria.

10) According to the HSAB principle, which combination is generally expected to be the most stable?
A. Hard acid with hard base  
B. Hard acid with soft base  
C. Soft acid with hard base  
D. Stability is unrelated to hardness/softness  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: HSAB states that hard–hard and soft–soft interactions are favored, so a hard acid binding to a hard base is generally more stable than hard–soft mismatches.
Hard–soft pairings are typically less favorable because hardness/softness reflects charge density and polarizability matching, which influences stability and reactivity trends.
