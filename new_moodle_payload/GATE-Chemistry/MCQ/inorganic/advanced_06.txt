1) The later lanthanides often show chemical similarity to certain 4d and 5d transition metals in their ionic radii and coordination behaviour. Which combination best rationalises this similarity?

A. Strong lanthanide contraction and poor 4f shielding  
B. Weak lanthanide contraction and strong 4f shielding  
C. Absence of 4f electrons in later lanthanides  
D. Dominant +2 oxidation state for all later lanthanides  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The strong lanthanide contraction arises because 4f electrons shield the increasing nuclear charge poorly, so the effective nuclear charge felt by outer electrons increases significantly from La to Lu.  This leads to a pronounced, nearly monotonic decrease in both atomic and ionic radii across the lanthanide series, especially for Ln³⁺ ions.  As a result, later lanthanides (such as Tb–Lu) attain radii comparable to those of certain 4d and 5d transition metals in similar oxidation states, giving rise to similarities in coordination numbers and ligand preferences.  Options invoking weak contraction, strong shielding, loss of 4f electrons, or a universal +2 oxidation state contradict the described physical basis and observed +3-dominated chemistry.

2) Consider two isostructural complexes: [Nd(H₂O)₉]³⁺ and [Lu(H₂O)₈]³⁺ in aqueous solution. Which integrated explanation best accounts for the difference in coordination number and metal–oxygen bond distances?

A. Increase in 4f covalency from Nd to Lu with negligible size change  
B. Lanthanide contraction reducing ionic radius and favouring lower coordination for Lu³⁺  
C. Complete loss of 4f electrons in Lu³⁺ causing stronger 6s bonding  
D. Change from +3 to +4 oxidation state from Nd to Lu  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Across the lanthanide series, the lanthanide contraction steadily decreases the ionic radii of Ln³⁺ ions due to poor 4f shielding and rising effective nuclear charge.  Smaller later ions such as Lu³⁺ accommodate fewer ligands in the first coordination sphere, which favours lower coordination numbers (e.g., 8 vs 9 for larger early ions like Nd³⁺) and shorter metal–oxygen distances.  The dominant bonding remains largely ionic with limited 4f covalency, so a dramatic covalency increase alone does not primarily govern coordination-number changes.  There is no oxidation-state change from Nd³⁺ to Lu³⁺, and Lu³⁺ retains a 4f¹⁴ configuration rather than losing all 4f character for enhanced 6s bonding.

3) A spectroscopist compares the electronic spectra of a Ln³⁺ aqua complex and an isoelectronic An³⁺ complex with the same ligand set. The actinide complex shows broader, more intense bands extending into the visible, while the lanthanide complex exhibits sharp, weak f–f lines. Which integrated factor best explains this contrast?

A. Actinides lack f–f transitions and show only intra-ligand bands  
B. 5f orbitals in actinides are more radially extended, enhancing covalency and charge-transfer transitions  
C. 4f orbitals in lanthanides are more diffuse, causing strong charge-transfer bands  
D. Spin–orbit coupling is negligible in actinides but dominant in lanthanides  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The 5f orbitals in actinides are less shielded and more radially extended than the 4f orbitals in lanthanides, so they overlap more effectively with ligand orbitals and give greater metal–ligand covalency.  This enhanced interaction favours intense ligand-to-metal and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (CT) bands that are broad and often dominate actinide spectra.  In lanthanides, 4f orbitals are more core-like and shielded by 5s and 5p shells, leading to weak ligand field effects and narrow, Laporte-forbidden f–f transitions with low intensity.  Statements denying f–f transitions in actinides or reversing the relative diffuseness of 4f vs 5f orbitals ignore the central role of 5f–ligand overlap in actinide spectral behaviour, and spin–orbit coupling is important in both series rather than negligible in actinides.

4) A chemist wants to separate Eu and Gd from a mixed lanthanide chloride solution using a combination of redox chemistry and ion-exchange chromatography. Which conceptual strategy most effectively exploits their electronic structures and magnetic properties?

A. Oxidise both to +4 and separate based on identical f-electron counts  
B. Reduce Eu³⁺ to Eu²⁺ while keeping Gd as Gd³⁺, then separate using different complexation and ionic sizes  
C. Oxidise Gd³⁺ to Gd⁴⁺ while keeping Eu³⁺ unchanged, then rely only on their different magnetic moments  
D. Keep both in +3 state and depend solely on their similar ionic radii in a single ion-exchange step  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Eu readily forms a stable +2 oxidation state (Eu²⁺) associated with a half-filled 4f⁷ configuration, whereas Gd remains most stable as Gd³⁺, also with a 4f⁷ configuration but different charge and radius.  Reducing Eu³⁺ to Eu²⁺ changes its charge, ionic size, and complexation behaviour relative to Gd³⁺, which can be exploited in ion-exchange chromatography or solvent extraction for efficient separation.  Keeping both ions in +3 state leaves them very similar in radius and chemistry due to the lanthanide contraction, making separation far more difficult.  Oxidation to +4 is not generally favourable for these specific elements, and relying only on magnetic differences without altering charge and coordination chemistry is not the standard industrial or laboratory strategy described for lanthanide separations.

5) For a lanthanide ion with a 4f⁹ configuration in the +3 oxidation state, application of Hund’s rules and LS coupling gives a ground state with significant orbital angular momentum and nonzero J. How does this influence both its magnetic moment and the way crystal fields perturb its electronic spectrum compared to a 4f⁷ Ln³⁺ ion?

A. The 4f⁹ ion has purely spin-only behaviour and is insensitive to crystal fields, unlike 4f⁷  
B. Both ions have L ≈ 0, so crystal-field splitting and magnetic moments are identical  
C. The 4f⁹ ion has larger orbital contribution to μeff and shows more pronounced crystal-field-induced Stark splitting of f–f levels  
D. The 4f⁷ ion always has a larger orbital contribution and stronger crystal-field effects than 4f⁹  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: In LS coupling, a 4f⁷ configuration such as Gd³⁺ has L ≈ 0 and a ground state with J = S, so its magnetic moment is close to the spin-only value and crystal-field perturbations of its f–f manifold are comparatively modest.  By contrast, a 4f⁹ Ln³⁺ ion possesses nonzero L and a ground-state term with significant total J, giving a magnetic moment that includes substantial orbital contribution via the appropriate J-dependent formula rather than simple spin-only.  Nonzero L also makes the ion more sensitive to crystal-field splitting, so its f–f transitions show more pronounced Stark components and fine structure than in the L ≈ 0 case.  Options that claim identical L for both ions or that assign stronger orbital effects to the half-filled 4f⁷ configuration contradict the LS-coupling and Hund’s-rule description used for lanthanide spectra and magnetism.
