1) In the Monsanto acetic acid process (Rh-catalyzed carbonylation), the catalytic cycle explicitly features which paired elementary steps as highlighted in the syllabus outline?
A. Oxidative addition followed by CO migratory insertion
B. Reductive elimination followed by β-hydride elimination
C. σ-bond metathesis followed by radical abstraction
D. Associative substitution followed by ligand rotation only

Correct answer: Oxidative addition followed by CO migratory insertion

Explanation: The Monsanto process is presented as a Rh-based carbonylation cycle in which oxidative addition and CO insertion are key elementary organometallic steps used to build the acyl functionality leading to acetic acid.  Oxidative addition is consistent with increasing metal oxidation state/coordination number and is one of the named elementary reactions emphasized for catalytic cycles in organometallic chemistry.  CO migratory insertion is the characteristic step that converts a metal–alkyl (or related) bond into a metal–acyl linkage, which aligns with carbonylation chemistry.  β-hydride elimination is discussed in the context of metal–alkyl stability and is central to some oxidation/hydride chemistry, but it is not the defining pair of steps highlighted for Monsanto carbonylation in the provided outline.  Purely radical abstraction or “ligand rotation only” does not capture the named mechanistic framework of oxidative addition/insertion used in organometallic catalytic cycles.

2) Olefin metathesis is taught as proceeding through metal–carbene intermediates, and the syllabus explicitly contrasts Grubbs and Schrock catalysts.  Which statement best matches the mechanistic implication of this emphasis?
A. The key bond reorganization involves a metal–carbene-mediated interchange of C=C fragments rather than a simple oxidative addition/reductive elimination pair on a saturated alkyl.
B. The key step is always β-hydride elimination from a metal–alkyl to generate the new alkene distribution.
C. The catalyst must be heterogeneous and surface-bound for metathesis to occur.
D. Metathesis proceeds without any metal–carbon bond formation at any point in the cycle.

Correct answer: The key bond reorganization involves a metal–carbene-mediated interchange of C=C fragments rather than a simple oxidative addition/reductive elimination pair on a saturated alkyl.

Explanation: The outline explicitly connects metathesis to metal–carbene complexes and names Grubbs and Schrock catalysts, which signals that a metal–carbene intermediate is central to C=C bond rearrangement.  This framing distinguishes metathesis from catalytic manifolds dominated by oxidative addition/reductive elimination at a metal center acting mainly on σ-bonds.  β-hydride elimination is an important elementary step for metal–alkyl complexes, but it does not explain the hallmark exchange of alkylidene fragments and redistribution of C=C bonds in metathesis.  The syllabus places metathesis under homogeneous catalysis topics, so “must be heterogeneous” is inconsistent with the stated categorization.  Denying metal–carbon bond formation contradicts the stated involvement of metal–carbene species, which are defined by strong metal–carbon multiple-bond character.

3) \(\mathrm{Fe(CO)_5}\) is listed as a classic example in the fluxionality section.  Which interpretation best explains why room-temperature NMR can show fewer distinct CO environments than expected from a static trigonal-bipyramidal structure?
A. Rapid intramolecular rearrangement exchanges axial and equatorial positions on the NMR timescale, averaging environments.
B. CO ligands permanently dissociate and reassociate, changing the molecular formula during measurement.
C. The complex becomes diamagnetic only at high temperature, which collapses peaks by changing spin state.
D. IR spectroscopy selection rules directly force NMR signals to merge.

Correct answer: Rapid intramolecular rearrangement exchanges axial and equatorial positions on the NMR timescale, averaging environments.

Explanation: The fluxionality topic is defined as dynamic intramolecular rearrangement observable by NMR, and \(\mathrm{Fe(CO)_5}\) is specifically listed as a representative example.  When exchange is fast relative to the NMR timescale, nuclei in distinct sites become time-averaged, giving fewer signals and often a single averaged resonance set at sufficiently high temperature.  Permanent dissociation/reassociation would imply a different chemical speciation rather than classic fluxional averaging and is not required to explain the NMR behavior emphasized in the fluxionality section.  Diamagnetism changes do not inherently collapse inequivalent-site resonances into one unless an exchange process averages them, and the provided framework points to dynamics rather than spin-state switching.  IR selection rules govern vibrational transitions and do not directly force NMR coalescence, which is tied to chemical exchange kinetics and coalescence behavior described in the NMR-focused fluxionality content.

4) Hydroformylation is emphasized with “linear vs branched aldehydes” and “ligand effects on selectivity and activity.”  Which statement best captures how ligand choice is used mechanistically in such a catalytic cycle?
A. Ligands tune the steric/electronic environment at the metal to bias alkene coordination/insertion pathways, shifting the linear-to-branched aldehyde ratio.
B. Ligands only change the color of the catalyst solution and do not affect regioselectivity.
C. Ligands enforce heterogeneous surface growth, which is the primary cause of linear selectivity.
D. Ligands eliminate the need for CO in hydroformylation by generating CO in situ from the alkene.

Correct answer: Ligands tune the steric/electronic environment at the metal to bias alkene coordination/insertion pathways, shifting the linear-to-branched aldehyde ratio.

Explanation: The hydroformylation learning objectives explicitly connect regioselectivity (linear vs branched aldehydes) with ligand effects on selectivity and activity, implying ligands control key coordination and insertion steps in the catalytic cycle.  In organometallic reaction language, such control is naturally discussed in terms of how ligands affect binding modes, migratory insertion preferences, and the relative rates of competing pathways.  Treating ligands as merely cosmetic contradicts the stated focus on ligand effects as a conceptual learning point.  Hydroformylation is categorized under homogeneous catalysis in the outline, so attributing selectivity primarily to heterogeneous surface growth conflicts with the given context.  CO is a core reagent in hydroformylation as presented in the mechanism-focused section headings, so claiming ligands remove the need for CO misrepresents the process emphasis.

5) Ziegler–Natta polymerization is presented with “olefin insertion into Ti–carbon bond,” “coordination control,” and “tacticity control.”  Which statement best integrates these ideas into a mechanistic rationale for stereospecificity?
A. A chiral or stereoregulating environment at the active site controls how the alkene coordinates before repeated insertions into the metal–carbon bond, producing tactic polymers.
B. Stereospecificity arises mainly because the monomer is optically active, independent of the catalyst.
C. Tacticity is determined after polymerization by thermal annealing, not during chain growth.
D. The polymer grows by radical chain reactions in solution, so insertion into a metal–carbon bond is not involved.

Correct answer: A chiral or stereoregulating environment at the active site controls how the alkene coordinates before repeated insertions into the metal–carbon bond, producing tactic polymers.

Explanation: The outline explicitly ties stereospecific polymerization to olefin insertion into a Ti–C bond and highlights coordination control and tacticity, which together indicate that active-site geometry governs monomer approach and orientation during each insertion step.  This is a direct mechanism-level explanation for how isotactic, syndiotactic, or atactic outcomes can arise from catalyst-controlled propagation rather than from post-processing.  Monomer optical activity is not required for tacticity control in the framework presented, because the focus is on catalyst-based stereocontrol at coordination/insertion.  Thermal annealing can change crystallinity and morphology, but it cannot retroactively impose a stereochemical sequence that was not created during chain propagation.  The text emphasizes an insertion mechanism at a transition-metal center rather than free-radical chain growth, so a purely radical pathway contradicts the stated mechanistic focus.
