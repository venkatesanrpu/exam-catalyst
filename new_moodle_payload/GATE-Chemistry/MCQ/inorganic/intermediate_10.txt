1) A cubic crystal has lattice parameter \(a = 4.00\ \text{Å}\); for the (210) planes, the first-order Bragg reflection is observed using X-rays of wavelength \( \lambda = 1.54\ \text{Å}\).  The diffraction angle \(\theta\) is closest to:
A. 12.8°
B. 25.5°
C. 51.0°
D. 77.2°

Correct answer: B

Explanation: For cubic crystals, interplanar spacing is \(d_{hkl} = a/\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}\), so \(d_{210} = 4.00/\sqrt{5} = 1.79\ \text{Å}\) (approx.).  Using Bragg’s law \(n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta\) with \(n=1\), \(\sin\theta = 1.54/(2\times 1.79) \approx 0.431\), giving \(\theta \approx 25.5^\circ\).  A smaller angle would correspond to a larger \(d\) than computed, while larger angles would require \(\sin\theta\) closer to 1 than allowed by the given \(d\) and \(\lambda\).

2) A metal crystallizes in the BCC structure with unit-cell edge \(a = 3.00\ \text{Å}\).  The atomic radius \(r\) is closest to:
A. 0.75 Å
B. 1.06 Å
C. 1.30 Å
D. 1.50 Å

Correct answer: C

Explanation: In BCC packing, atoms touch along the body diagonal, so \(4r = \sqrt{3}\,a\) relates atomic radius and lattice parameter.  Substituting \(a=3.00\ \text{Å}\) gives \(r = (\sqrt{3}\times 3.00)/4 \approx 1.30\ \text{Å}\).  The smaller radii correspond to using the face diagonal or edge contact relations (appropriate to other lattices), while a much larger radius would imply overlapping atoms beyond the BCC geometry.

3) Anions \(X^-\) form an FCC array, and cations \(M^+\) occupy 75% of the tetrahedral voids.  The empirical formula is:
A. MX
B. M2X
C. M3X2
D. MX2

Correct answer: C

Explanation: An FCC unit cell contains 4 anions, and it has 8 tetrahedral voids associated with that close-packed arrangement.  Occupying 75% of tetrahedral voids gives \(0.75\times 8 = 6\) cations per unit cell, so the ratio \(M:X = 6:4 = 3:2\), hence \( \mathrm{M_3X_2}\).  MX would correspond to filling all octahedral voids (not tetrahedral), and MX2 would correspond to filling all tetrahedral voids (100% occupancy).

4) For an ionic solid of type AX, the radius ratio \(r_+/r_- = 0.50\).  The most likely coordination number for the cation and a matching prototype are:
A. 4 coordination; ZnS-type
B. 6 coordination; NaCl-type
C. 8 coordination; CsCl-type
D. 12 coordination; close-packed metallic

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Radius ratio rules connect \(r_+/r_-\) to likely coordination environments, and a mid-range value like 0.50 is consistent with octahedral (6-fold) coordination.  For AX compounds, a common 6:6 coordinated ionic structure is the NaCl-type arrangement.  Tetrahedral (4-fold) coordination is expected at smaller ratios, while 8-fold coordination requires a larger cation-to-anion size ratio than 0.50.

5) In an NaCl-type crystal, \(1\) in \(10^6\) formula units contains a Schottky defect pair at equilibrium.  The total number of vacancies (cation vacancies + anion vacancies) per mole is closest to:
A. \(6.0\times 10^{17}\)
B. \(1.2\times 10^{18}\)
C. \(6.0\times 10^{23}\)
D. \(1.2\times 10^{24}\)

Correct answer: B

Explanation: A Schottky defect pair in an ionic crystal corresponds to one cation vacancy plus one anion vacancy, maintaining overall stoichiometry and charge balance.  If \(1\) in \(10^6\) formula units has a Schottky pair, then in 1 mole the number of pairs is \(N_A/10^6 \approx 6.022\times 10^{17}\), so total vacancies are \(2\times 6.022\times 10^{17} \approx 1.2\times 10^{18}\).  The smaller value counts only pairs (not total vacancies), while values near \(10^{23}\)–\(10^{24}\) incorrectly treat the defect fraction as order unity.

6) Which statement best describes what Kröger–Vink notation helps represent in defect chemistry?
A. It gives the Miller indices of defect planes responsible for diffraction broadening
B. It systematically describes point defects, their lattice site, and effective charge relative to the perfect crystal
C. It classifies crystals into 7 systems and 14 Bravais lattices
D. It directly computes packing efficiencies of FCC, HCP, and BCC lattices

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Kröger–Vink notation is used in ionic solids to describe point defects in a structured way, including where the defect sits (site information) and how its effective charge compares with the ideal lattice.  Miller indices label planes and directions, not defect species.  Crystal-system/Bravais-lattice classification and packing-efficiency calculations are separate crystallography topics and are not the role of Kröger–Vink notation.

7) In a powder XRD experiment using \( \lambda = 1.54\ \text{Å}\), a first-order peak occurs at \(2\theta = 30^\circ\).  The corresponding interplanar spacing \(d\) is closest to:
A. 0.77 Å
B. 1.49 Å
C. 2.97 Å
D. 5.94 Å

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Bragg’s law is \(n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta\), and \(2\theta=30^\circ\) implies \(\theta=15^\circ\).  With \(n=1\), \(d = \lambda/(2\sin 15^\circ) \approx 1.54/(2\times 0.259) \approx 2.97\ \text{Å}\).  The smaller spacings arise from mistakenly using \(2\theta\) in place of \(\theta\), while the largest spacing corresponds to doubling \(d\) by missing the factor of 2 in Bragg’s law.

8) In the fluorite (AX2) structure type, the correct assignment of the FCC sublattice and interstitial occupancy is:
A. Cations form FCC; anions occupy all tetrahedral voids
B. Anions form FCC; cations occupy all tetrahedral voids
C. Cations form FCC; anions occupy all octahedral voids
D. Anions form FCC; cations occupy all octahedral voids

Correct answer: A

Explanation: AX2 structures include fluorite as a key prototype, and understanding them relies on identifying which species forms the close-packed (FCC) framework and which occupies interstitial sites.  In fluorite-type description, one ion forms the FCC lattice and the counter-ion fills tetrahedral positions consistent with AX2 stoichiometry.  Choosing octahedral void filling would instead lead to an AX stoichiometry for an FCC framework, not AX2.

9) For an inverse spinel of composition AB2O4, the cation distribution among tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh) sites is best represented as:
A. (A)Td [B2]Oh
B. (B)Td [AB]Oh
C. (AB)Td [B]Oh
D. (A2)Td [B]Oh

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Spinel structures are AB2X4-type complex oxides where “normal” and “inverse” forms differ by how cations distribute between tetrahedral and octahedral sites.  In an inverse spinel, the tetrahedral sites are occupied by B cations, while octahedral sites are occupied by A plus the remaining B cations, matching (B)Td[AB]Oh.  The distribution (A)Td[B2]Oh corresponds to a normal spinel arrangement, while the other distributions violate the AB2 stoichiometry across available Td/Oh site types.

10) Silicon is doped with a small amount of phosphorus.  Relative to intrinsic Si, the correct statement about majority carriers and Fermi level shift is:
A. Holes become majority carriers; Fermi level shifts toward the valence band
B. Electrons become majority carriers; Fermi level shifts toward the conduction band
C. Electrons become majority carriers; Fermi level shifts toward the valence band
D. Holes become majority carriers; Fermi level remains fixed at mid-gap

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Doping and carrier concentration concepts explain how adding impurities changes semiconductor conductivity by changing the dominant charge carriers.  A group-15 dopant like phosphorus donates extra electrons in Si, making electrons the majority carriers and shifting the Fermi level upward toward the conduction band compared with the intrinsic case.  A shift toward the valence band and hole-majority behavior would correspond to acceptor (p-type) doping, not donor doping.
