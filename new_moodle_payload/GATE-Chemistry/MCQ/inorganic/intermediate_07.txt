1) Using the neutral (covalent) electron-counting method, the total valence electron count at Fe in \(\mathrm{Fe(\eta^5\!-\!C_5H_5)(CO)_2CH_3}\) is:
A. 16
B. 17
C. 18
D. 20

Correct answer: C

Explanation: In neutral counting, Fe contributes 8 electrons (group 8 metal).  The \(\eta^5\)-cyclopentadienyl ligand contributes 5 electrons, each CO contributes 2 electrons, and the methyl (alkyl) contributes 1 electron, giving \(8 + 5 + 2+2 + 1 = 18\).  The 16-electron result typically comes from incorrectly treating Cp as a 6-electron donor in the neutral method or forgetting the alkyl contribution.  The 17-electron result usually comes from dropping one electron contribution (often the alkyl) or mixing ionic and neutral conventions.  The 20-electron result generally reflects double-counting the Cp donation or assigning incorrect electron donation numbers.

2) The formal oxidation state of Mn in \(\mathrm{[Mn(CO)_5Br]}\) is:
A. 0
B. +1
C. +2
D. −1

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In oxidation-state assignment for organometallics, CO is treated as a neutral ligand, while bromide is treated as \(\mathrm{Br^-}\).  Since the overall complex is neutral, the metal must balance the −1 charge from bromide, so Mn is +1.  Assigning Mn as 0 incorrectly treats bromide as neutral, and +2 would require an additional anionic ligand or overall positive charge.  A −1 oxidation state would require the ligand set to be net positive (not the case here).

3) In an oxidative addition of \(\mathrm{H_2}\) to a 16-electron square-planar \(\mathrm{d^8}\) complex (typical late metal chemistry), the electron count at the metal center most commonly becomes:
A. 14 electrons
B. 16 electrons
C. 18 electrons
D. 20 electrons

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Oxidative addition adds two new metal–ligand bonds and typically increases both oxidation state and coordination number.  In electron-counting terms, adding \(\mathrm{H_2}\) as two hydride ligands commonly increases the metal valence electron count by 2, converting a 16-electron species to an 18-electron species.  A drop to 14 would correspond to ligand loss or reductive elimination-like behavior rather than oxidative addition.  A final count of 20 would exceed the common 18-electron stability guideline for many low-spin organometallic complexes and usually indicates incorrect counting.

4) A metal–alkyl complex \(\mathrm{M{-}CH_2CH_3}\) undergoes β-hydride elimination to give a metal hydride and an alkene. The alkene formed is:
A. Methane
B. Ethene
C. Propene
D. Ethyne

Correct answer: B

Explanation: β-hydride elimination removes a hydrogen from the β-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the metal-bound carbon) and forms a C=C bond between the α and β carbons while generating \(\mathrm{M{-}H}\).  For an ethyl ligand (\(\mathrm{-CH_2CH_3}\)), the α–β pair is exactly two carbons, so the resulting alkene is ethene (\(\mathrm{CH_2{=}CH_2}\)).  Methane would correspond to protonation/hydrogenolysis, propene would require a three-carbon chain, and ethyne would require a different elimination pathway that creates a triple bond.

5) Consider a metal carbonyl series where the metal oxidation state becomes more negative (more electron-rich metal center). The \(\nu_{\mathrm{CO}}\) stretching frequency in IR is expected to:
A. Increase due to reduced backbonding
B. Decrease due to increased backbonding
C. Stay constant because \(\nu_{\mathrm{CO}}\) depends only on the number of CO ligands
D. Become zero because CO no longer vibrates

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Increased electron density at the metal generally enhances metal-to-CO π backbonding into CO π* orbitals, weakening the C–O bond.  Weakening the internal C–O bond lowers the CO stretching frequency, so \(\nu_{\mathrm{CO}}\) decreases.  An increase would be consistent with less backbonding and a stronger C–O bond, which contradicts the electron-rich metal premise.  The number of CO ligands matters for patterns, but the frequency is strongly influenced by bonding (especially backbonding), and vibrational motion does not vanish upon coordination.

6) In the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, stronger metal→olefin π backdonation most directly leads to which change in the coordinated alkene?
A. Shorter C=C bond and higher C=C stretching frequency
B. Longer C=C bond and lower C=C stretching frequency
C. No change in C=C bond length; only metal–carbon bonds change
D. Conversion of the alkene into an alkane without any reaction step

Correct answer: B

Explanation: π backdonation populates the olefin π* orbital, reducing the C=C bond order and therefore lengthening the C=C bond.  Reduced bond order typically lowers the C=C stretching frequency relative to the free alkene.  Claiming “no change” ignores the central predictive value of the model for structure–bonding correlations in metal–olefin complexes.  Formation of an alkane requires additional reaction steps (such as hydrogenation) and is not an automatic consequence of coordination alone.

7) A student proposes that in a catalytic cycle, “migratory insertion of CO into a metal–alkyl bond” directly forms:
A. A metal–alkoxide (M–OR)
B. A metal–acyl (M–C(O)R)
C. A metal–hydride (M–H)
D. A metal–carbene (M=CR2)

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Migratory insertion of CO into a metal–alkyl bond inserts CO between the metal and the alkyl group, converting \(\mathrm{M{-}R}\) into an acyl linkage \(\mathrm{M{-}C(O)R}\).  A metal–alkoxide would typically arise from insertion of an oxygen-containing molecule or from nucleophilic attack on a coordinated CO followed by further transformations, not the elementary CO insertion step itself.  Metal hydride formation is more directly tied to steps like oxidative addition of \(\mathrm{H_2}\), β-hydride elimination, or hydride transfer processes.  Metal carbenes are characteristic intermediates in carbene chemistry and metathesis, not the standard direct outcome of CO insertion into an alkyl bond.

8) A complex shows two distinct ligand environments at low temperature in NMR, but only one averaged signal at higher temperature due to fluxionality. The temperature at which the two signals merge into one is called:
A. Decomposition temperature
B. Coalescence temperature
C. Melting point
D. Boiling point

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Fluxional organometallic complexes can undergo rapid intramolecular rearrangements that average NMR environments on the NMR timescale.  The specific temperature where two separate resonances merge into a single resonance is termed the coalescence temperature and is used along with models to estimate rate constants.  Decomposition temperature is unrelated to dynamic exchange averaging, and melting/boiling points are bulk phase-change properties not defined by NMR line-shape behavior.

9) In the Wacker-type Pd-catalyzed oxidation of an alkene, the role commonly attributed to \(\mathrm{CuCl_2}\) (or related copper salt) is to:
A. Act as the alkene source
B. Reoxidize Pd(0) back to Pd(II) in the catalytic cycle
C. Convert the alkene into a metal carbene for metathesis
D. Serve as the solid support for heterogeneous catalysis

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In Pd-catalyzed olefin oxidation (Wacker-type chemistry), the palladium center cycles between Pd(II) and Pd(0), and a reoxidant is needed to regenerate Pd(II).  Copper chloride is commonly used to reoxidize Pd(0) back to Pd(II), enabling turnover of the catalytic cycle.  Copper salts are not the alkene source, do not primarily generate metathesis carbenes in this context, and do not function as a heterogeneous solid support in the typical homogeneous Wacker system.

10) A Ziegler–Natta catalyst system is best described as a combination of:
A. A titanium halide and an alkylaluminum cocatalyst that generates active sites for olefin insertion polymerization
B. A rhodium phosphine complex used mainly for alkene hydrogenation
C. An iron or cobalt surface catalyst used mainly for syngas-to-hydrocarbon conversion
D. A ruthenium carbene complex used mainly for C=C bond metathesis

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Ziegler–Natta polymerization is taught as a heterogeneous catalytic system where titanium-based halides are activated by organoaluminum cocatalysts to form active centers that insert alkenes and control stereochemistry (tacticity).  Rhodium phosphine complexes are highlighted in homogeneous hydrogenation (Wilkinson-type) rather than Ziegler–Natta polymerization.  Iron/cobalt surface catalysts align with Fischer–Tropsch syngas conversion, and ruthenium carbene complexes align with olefin metathesis catalysis rather than Ziegler–Natta insertion polymerization.
