## Part 1: Basic (10 MCQs)

1) Radioactivity is best described as:  
A. Spontaneous emission of radiation from unstable nuclei  
B. Emission of visible light from excited atoms only  
C. Chemical decomposition of unstable molecules into radicals  
D. Loss of electrons from atoms due to heating  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus transforms and emits radiation (such as alpha, beta, or gamma). Emission of visible light from excited atoms is an electronic transition, not a nuclear change. Chemical decomposition concerns rearrangement of electrons in bonds, not changes in the nucleus. Heating can cause thermionic emission or ionization, but that is not radioactivity.

2) In terms of nucleon numbers, alpha decay of a nuclide \(\,^{A}_{Z}X\,\) produces a daughter nuclide with:  
A. Mass number \(A-2\) and atomic number \(Z-2\)  
B. Mass number \(A-4\) and atomic number \(Z-2\)  
C. Mass number \(A-4\) and atomic number \(Z-4\)  
D. Mass number \(A\) and atomic number \(Z-2\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: An alpha particle is a \(\,^{4}_{2}\mathrm{He}\,\) nucleus, so emission reduces the parent mass number by 4 and atomic number by 2. A reduction by 2 in mass number corresponds to losing two nucleons only, which is not an alpha particle. Reducing atomic number by 4 would imply loss of four protons, which is not the alpha process. Keeping mass number unchanged would contradict emission of a massive particle.

3) Which statement correctly distinguishes gamma emission from alpha and beta decay?  
A. Gamma emission changes the mass number of the nucleus.  
B. Gamma emission changes the atomic number of the nucleus.  
C. Gamma emission changes neither mass number nor atomic number, but lowers nuclear energy.  
D. Gamma emission converts a proton into a neutron.  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Gamma rays are high-energy photons emitted when an excited nucleus de-excites, so nucleon counts (A and Z) remain unchanged while nuclear energy decreases. Changing mass number requires emission of massive particles (like alpha) or nucleon loss. Changing atomic number occurs in beta processes or electron capture, not in pure gamma emission. Converting a proton into a neutron is characteristic of positron emission or electron capture, not gamma emission.

4) The mass defect of a nucleus is defined as:  
A. Difference between the measured atomic mass and the mass number  
B. Difference between the total mass of separated nucleons and the actual nuclear mass  
C. Difference between the number of neutrons and the number of protons  
D. Difference between the nucleus radius and atomic radius  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Mass defect is the “missing mass” when separated protons and neutrons bind to form a nucleus, reflecting conversion of mass into binding energy. Mass number is a count, not a mass, so comparing it directly to measured mass is not the definition. Neutron–proton difference relates to stability trends but is not mass defect. Radii differences are geometric properties and do not define mass defect.

5) Binding energy is most directly related to mass defect by:  
A. \(E = \Delta m\,c^2\)  
B. \(E = \Delta m/c^2\)  
C. \(E = c^2/\Delta m\)  
D. \(E = \Delta m\,c\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Nuclear binding energy corresponds to the energy equivalent of mass defect via Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence, \(E=\Delta m c^2\). Dividing by \(c^2\) would convert energy into mass, not mass into energy. Inverting \(\Delta m\) has no physical basis here. Multiplying by \(c\) gives incorrect units and does not represent mass–energy equivalence.

6) In \(\beta^-\) decay, the nuclear change responsible for electron emission is best represented as:  
A. \(\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{n} + e^- \)  
B. \(\mathrm{n} \rightarrow \mathrm{p} + e^- \)  
C. \(\mathrm{n} \rightarrow \mathrm{p} + e^+ \)  
D. \(\mathrm{p} + e^- \rightarrow \mathrm{n}\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In \(\beta^-\) decay, a neutron converts into a proton with emission of an electron (and an antineutrino, often omitted in basic notation). Converting a proton into a neutron with electron emission is not the \(\beta^-\) process. Positron emission corresponds to \(\beta^+\) decay, not \(\beta^-\). Electron capture corresponds to a proton capturing an inner electron to form a neutron, which is a different mode.

7) A Geiger–Müller (GM) counter primarily detects radiation by measuring:  
A. Increase in temperature of the gas due to radiation heating  
B. Ionization produced in a gas-filled tube leading to an electrical pulse  
C. Formation of photographic images on a film inside the detector  
D. Chemical reaction rate changes caused by radiation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A GM counter is a gas-filled ionization detector; radiation creates ion pairs and triggers an avalanche, producing detectable pulses. Heating is not the operating principle of GM tubes. Photographic film detection is a separate dosimetry/recording method, not GM counting. Radiation can induce chemical changes, but GM counters do not measure chemical kinetics.

8) For a radioactive sample, after exactly two half-lives, the fraction of nuclei remaining is:  
A. \(1/2\)  
B. \(1/3\)  
C. \(1/4\)  
D. \(1/8\)  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Each half-life reduces the number of undecayed nuclei by a factor of 2, so after two half-lives the remaining fraction is \((1/2)^2 = 1/4\). A remaining fraction of \(1/2\) corresponds to only one half-life. A fraction \(1/3\) does not arise from repeated halving. A fraction \(1/8\) corresponds to three half-lives.

9) The Q-value of a nuclear reaction is best interpreted as:  
A. The total number of neutrons produced in the reaction  
B. The energy released (positive) or absorbed (negative) by the reaction  
C. The rate constant of radioactive decay  
D. The probability that a detector will register a count  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Q-value is the net energy change of a nuclear process, determined by mass–energy differences between reactants and products. Neutron yield is a different quantity and depends on the specific reaction channel. Decay rate constants describe spontaneous decay kinetics, not reaction energetics. Detector registration probability depends on efficiency and geometry, not on the reaction Q-value.

10) Which statement correctly identifies a key distinction between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?  
A. Fission combines light nuclei; fusion splits heavy nuclei.  
B. Fission splits heavy nuclei; fusion combines light nuclei.  
C. Both processes are chemical reactions involving electron transfer.  
D. Both processes always require absorption of energy (endothermic).  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Fission is the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter fragments, while fusion is the combination of light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. Reversing these descriptions swaps the processes incorrectly. Both are nuclear processes, not chemical electron-transfer reactions. Many fission and fusion reactions release energy, so they are not always endothermic.
