      <text><![CDATA[The Monsanto process is presented as a Rh-based carbonylation cycle in which oxidative addition and CO insertion are key elementary organometallic steps used to build the acyl functionality leading to acetic acid.  Oxidative addition is consistent with increasing metal oxidation state/coordination number and is one of the named elementary reactions emphasized for catalytic cycles in organometallic chemistry.  CO migratory insertion is the characteristic step that converts a metal–alkyl (or related) bond into a metal–acyl linkage, which aligns with carbonylation chemistry.  β-hydride elimination is discussed in the context of metal–alkyl stability and is central to some oxidation/hydride chemistry, but it is not the defining pair of steps highlighted for Monsanto carbonylation in the provided outline.  Purely radical abstraction or “ligand rotation only” does not capture the named mechanistic framework of oxidative addition/insertion used in organometallic catalytic cycles.]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[The outline explicitly connects metathesis to metal–carbene complexes and names Grubbs and Schrock catalysts, which signals that a metal–carbene intermediate is central to C=C bond rearrangement.  This framing distinguishes metathesis from catalytic manifolds dominated by oxidative addition/reductive elimination at a metal center acting mainly on σ-bonds.  β-hydride elimination is an important elementary step for metal–alkyl complexes, but it does not explain the hallmark exchange of alkylidene fragments and redistribution of C=C bonds in metathesis.  The syllabus places metathesis under homogeneous catalysis topics, so “must be heterogeneous” is inconsistent with the stated categorization.  Denying metal–carbon bond formation contradicts the stated involvement of metal–carbene species, which are defined by strong metal–carbon multiple-bond character.]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[The fluxionality topic is defined as dynamic intramolecular rearrangement observable by NMR, and \(\mathrm{Fe(CO)_5}\) is specifically listed as a representative example.  When exchange is fast relative to the NMR timescale, nuclei in distinct sites become time-averaged, giving fewer signals and often a single averaged resonance set at sufficiently high temperature.  Permanent dissociation/reassociation would imply a different chemical speciation rather than classic fluxional averaging and is not required to explain the NMR behavior emphasized in the fluxionality section.  Diamagnetism changes do not inherently collapse inequivalent-site resonances into one unless an exchange process averages them, and the provided framework points to dynamics rather than spin-state switching.  IR selection rules govern vibrational transitions and do not directly force NMR coalescence, which is tied to chemical exchange kinetics and coalescence behavior described in the NMR-focused fluxionality content.]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[The hydroformylation learning objectives explicitly connect regioselectivity (linear vs branched aldehydes) with ligand effects on selectivity and activity, implying ligands control key coordination and insertion steps in the catalytic cycle.  In organometallic reaction language, such control is naturally discussed in terms of how ligands affect binding modes, migratory insertion preferences, and the relative rates of competing pathways.  Treating ligands as merely cosmetic contradicts the stated focus on ligand effects as a conceptual learning point.  Hydroformylation is categorized under homogeneous catalysis in the outline, so attributing selectivity primarily to heterogeneous surface growth conflicts with the given context.  CO is a core reagent in hydroformylation as presented in the mechanism-focused section headings, so claiming ligands remove the need for CO misrepresents the process emphasis.]]></text>

      <text><![CDATA[The outline explicitly ties stereospecific polymerization to olefin insertion into a Ti–C bond and highlights coordination control and tacticity, which together indicate that active-site geometry governs monomer approach and orientation during each insertion step.  This is a direct mechanism-level explanation for how isotactic, syndiotactic, or atactic outcomes can arise from catalyst-controlled propagation rather than from post-processing.  Monomer optical activity is not required for tacticity control in the framework presented, because the focus is on catalyst-based stereocontrol at coordination/insertion.  Thermal annealing can change crystallinity and morphology, but it cannot retroactively impose a stereochemical sequence that was not created during chain propagation.  The text emphasizes an insertion mechanism at a transition-metal center rather than free-radical chain growth, so a purely radical pathway contradicts the stated mechanistic focus.
