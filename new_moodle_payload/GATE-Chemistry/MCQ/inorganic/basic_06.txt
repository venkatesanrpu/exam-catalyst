Based on the attached file on Lanthanides and Actinides for GATE Chemistry, here are 10 Basic level MCQs:

***

1) The lanthanide elements in the periodic table are characterized by the progressive filling of which subshell?

A. 3d subshell  
B. 4f subshell  
C. 5d subshell  
D. 5f subshell  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Lanthanides (La–Lu) are f-block elements where the 4f subshell is progressively filled across the series. Their general electronic configuration is [Xe]4f^n where n varies from 0 to 14. The 3d subshell is filled in first-row transition metals. The 5d subshell is involved in third-row transition elements. The 5f subshell is progressively filled in actinides, not lanthanides.

2) What is the most common oxidation state exhibited by lanthanide elements in their compounds?

A. +2  
B. +3  
C. +4  
D. +5  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The dominant oxidation state for lanthanides is +3, which results from the loss of two 6s electrons and one 4f or 5d electron. This +3 state is remarkably stable across the entire lanthanide series. While +2 and +4 states exist for certain lanthanides like europium (+2) and cerium (+4), these are exceptions rather than the rule. The +5 oxidation state is not observed in lanthanides under normal conditions.

3) The lanthanide contraction refers to which observed trend across the lanthanide series?

A. Increase in atomic radius from La to Lu  
B. Steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii from La to Lu  
C. Increase in oxidation state from La to Lu  
D. Decrease in magnetic moment from La to Lu  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Lanthanide contraction is the steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii across the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium. This contraction occurs because 4f electrons shield the nuclear charge poorly, leading to a greater effective nuclear charge experienced by outer electrons as the atomic number increases. This phenomenon has important consequences for coordination chemistry and separation techniques. The contraction does not refer to changes in oxidation state or a systematic decrease in magnetic moment.

4) Which of the following minerals is a primary ore for the extraction of lanthanides?

A. Chalcopyrite  
B. Monazite  
C. Bauxite  
D. Galena  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Monazite is a phosphate mineral that serves as one of the primary ores for lanthanide extraction, along with bastnasite. Monazite typically contains lanthanides along with thorium. Chalcopyrite is a copper-iron sulfide mineral used for copper extraction. Bauxite is the primary ore for aluminum production. Galena is a lead sulfide mineral used for lead extraction.

***

5) The actinide series begins with actinium and ends with which element?

A. Uranium  
B. Plutonium  
C. Curium  
D. Lawrencium  

Correct answer: D

Explanation: The actinide series consists of 15 elements from actinium (Ac, atomic number 89) to lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103). These are f-block elements where the 5f subshell is progressively filled. Uranium, plutonium, and curium are all actinides but are located earlier in the series. Lawrencium is the last member of the actinide series, after which begins the 6d block.

***

6) Why do lanthanide complexes exhibit weak absorption bands in their electronic spectra?

A. Lanthanides have no d electrons  
B. The f–f transitions are Laporte forbidden  
C. Lanthanide ions do not form complexes  
D. The 4f orbitals are completely filled  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Lanthanide complexes show weak absorption bands because f–f electronic transitions are Laporte forbidden. The Laporte selection rule states that transitions between orbitals of the same parity are forbidden, and since f orbitals have defined parity, f–f transitions have very low intensity. Additionally, 4f electrons are well-shielded by outer electron shells, further reducing ligand field effects. The statement about having no d electrons is irrelevant to f–f transition intensity. Lanthanides do form stable complexes, and their 4f orbitals are not completely filled except in Lu³⁺.

***

7) The PUREX process is primarily used for the extraction and purification of which actinide element?

A. Thorium  
B. Plutonium  
C. Americium  
D. Curium  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: PUREX (Plutonium–Uranium Redox Extraction) is an industrial solvent extraction process primarily designed for the separation and purification of plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel. The process relies on selective extraction using tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon solvent. While thorium can be extracted from monazite using other methods, it is not the target of PUREX. Americium and curium require more specialized separation techniques beyond standard PUREX processing.

***

8) Which separation technique has historically been used for the isolation of individual lanthanides based on slight solubility differences?

A. Distillation  
B. Filtration  
C. Fractional crystallization  
D. Magnetic separation  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Fractional crystallization of lanthanide double salts (such as double sulfates or double nitrates) was historically employed to separate individual lanthanides based on their slight differences in solubility. This tedious method required hundreds of recrystallization steps due to the chemical similarity of lanthanides. Modern methods like ion-exchange chromatography and solvent extraction are now preferred. Distillation is unsuitable for separating lanthanide salts. Simple filtration cannot differentiate between dissolved lanthanide ions. Magnetic separation is not effective for lanthanide chemical separation.

***

9) In actinides, the oxidation states are more variable compared to lanthanides. Which range of oxidation states is observed in actinides?

A. +1 to +3  
B. +2 to +7  
C. +3 to +5  
D. +4 to +8  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Actinides exhibit highly variable oxidation states ranging from +2 to +7, unlike lanthanides which predominantly show +3. This variability arises because 5f electrons in actinides are less tightly held and can participate in bonding more readily than 4f electrons in lanthanides. For example, uranium can exist in +3, +4, +5, and +6 states, while plutonium can exhibit +3 through +7 oxidation states. Actinides do not commonly exhibit +8 oxidation states under normal chemical conditions.

***

10) The calculation of magnetic moments for lanthanide ions requires consideration of which coupling scheme due to strong spin–orbit interactions?

A. Jahn-Teller coupling  
B. Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling  
C. Molecular orbital coupling  
D. Ionic coupling  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling is used to derive term symbols and calculate magnetic moments for lanthanide ions because of significant spin–orbit coupling in these heavy elements. This coupling scheme combines individual spin and orbital angular momenta to give total S and L quantum numbers, which then couple to form the total angular momentum J. The magnetic moment formula incorporates the J quantum number. Jahn-Teller coupling refers to geometric distortion in degenerate electronic states. Molecular orbital coupling and ionic coupling are not standard coupling schemes for calculating lanthanide magnetic moments.
