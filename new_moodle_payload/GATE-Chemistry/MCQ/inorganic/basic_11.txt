1) In UV–Visible spectrophotometry, the Beer–Lambert law for absorbance is correctly represented by:
A. \(A=\varepsilon l c\)  
B. \(A=\varepsilon l /c\)  
C. \(A=\varepsilon c /l\)  
D. \(A=\varepsilon /(lc)\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Beer–Lambert law states that absorbance is directly proportional to concentration \(c\) and path length \(l\), with proportionality constant \(\varepsilon\) (molar absorptivity).
This is the basis for constructing calibration curves for quantitative analysis using UV–Vis instruments.
Expressions that place \(c\) or \(l\) in the denominator incorrectly predict lower absorbance for higher concentration or longer path length, which contradicts the law’s proportionality.
Such incorrect forms commonly arise from algebraic mistakes or confusing absorbance with transmittance relationships.

2) The key feature that most directly indicates **phosphorescence** (rather than fluorescence) is:
A. Radiative transition between two singlet states, typically very fast  
B. Radiative transition involving a triplet state, typically longer-lived  
C. Absorption of IR radiation causing vibrational excitation  
D. Absorption in the UV–Visible region due to σ–σ* transitions only  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Phosphorescence generally involves emission from a triplet excited state to a singlet ground state, making it slower due to spin-forbidden character.
Fluorescence is typically singlet-to-singlet emission and is therefore comparatively fast.
IR absorption is associated with vibrational transitions, not the electronic excited-state emission processes described in a Jablonski framework.
Restricting UV–Visible absorption to only σ–σ* transitions is incorrect because common bands also arise from π–π* and n–π* transitions.

3) In FTIR spectroscopy, the Michelson interferometer is primarily used to:
A. Directly disperse IR light into individual frequencies using a prism  
B. Generate an interferogram that is Fourier-transformed to obtain the spectrum  
C. Increase sample path length by multiple reflections (only)  
D. Convert absorbed IR energy directly into electrical current without a detector  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: FTIR uses an interferometer to encode all IR frequencies into an interferogram, which is mathematically converted (Fourier transform) into intensity versus wavenumber.
A prism/grating dispersion description corresponds to dispersive IR instruments rather than FTIR.
Multiple reflections relate to certain sampling accessories (like ATR or multipass cells), not the fundamental role of the interferometer in FTIR signal generation.
A detector is still required; the interferometer does not eliminate detection electronics.

***

4) In NMR spectroscopy, the most common reference compound for defining chemical shift (\(\delta\)) is:
A. Tetramethylsilane (TMS)  
B. Heavy water (D\(_2\)O)  
C. Sodium chloride (NaCl)  
D. Potassium bromide (KBr)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Chemical shift is reported relative to a reference standard, and TMS is widely used because it provides a convenient reference signal.
D\(_2\)O is commonly a solvent in NMR but does not serve as the universal chemical shift reference standard.
NaCl and KBr are associated with other laboratory contexts (e.g., ionic salts, IR pellet preparation) and do not define the NMR \(\delta\) scale.
Using a consistent reference is essential for comparing spectra across instruments and conditions.

***

5) A fundamental requirement for obtaining an ESR (EPR) signal is that the sample must:
A. Contain nuclei with spin \(I=0\) only  
B. Contain unpaired electrons (paramagnetic species)  
C. Be transparent in the UV–Visible region  
D. Be volatile and thermally stable for injection  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: ESR detects transitions associated with electron spin states in a magnetic field, so unpaired electrons are essential.
Nuclear-spin requirements are relevant to NMR, not ESR; ESR focuses on electron magnetic properties and the g-factor concept.
UV–Visible transparency is unrelated to ESR resonance conditions and does not determine ESR detectability.
Volatility and injection stability are considerations for GC, not for ESR spectroscopy.

***

6) In a mass spectrum, the base peak is best defined as:
A. The peak with the highest m/z value  
B. The peak corresponding to the molecular ion only  
C. The most intense peak, assigned 100% relative intensity  
D. The peak corresponding to the solvent signal  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum and is used as the reference for reporting relative intensities.
The highest m/z peak may or may not be the most intense, and it is not the definition of the base peak.
The molecular ion peak indicates molecular weight information but is not necessarily the most intense due to fragmentation patterns.
Solvent-related signals can appear depending on conditions, but they do not define what a base peak is.

***

7) In atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), the hollow cathode lamp is used mainly to provide:
A. A continuous broadband radiation source for all elements simultaneously  
B. Element-specific resonance line radiation for absorption by ground-state atoms  
C. An ion beam for mass-to-charge separation  
D. A radioactive gamma source for nuclear resonance absorption  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: AAS relies on absorption of element-specific radiation by free ground-state atoms, so a line source matched to the element is required.
A continuous broadband source is more typical of many molecular absorption spectrometers, whereas AAS commonly uses element-specific lamps.
Ion beams and m/z separation belong to mass spectrometry, not atomic absorption.
A radioactive gamma source is associated with Mössbauer spectroscopy, not AAS.

***

8) Which statement is correct regarding X-ray crystallography and Mössbauer spectroscopy?
A. Bragg’s law \(n\lambda=2d\sin\theta\) is central to X-ray diffraction for determining interplanar spacing  
B. Mössbauer spectroscopy primarily measures retention time to separate compounds  
C. X-ray crystallography directly provides g-factor values for radicals  
D. Mössbauer spectroscopy is based on IR absorption from molecular vibrations  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: X-ray crystallography uses diffraction and Bragg’s law to relate diffraction angles to lattice plane spacing \(d\), enabling structure determination.
Retention time is a chromatography concept (GC/HPLC), not a Mössbauer measurement.
g-Factor values are characteristic of ESR spectroscopy for paramagnetic species, not X-ray crystallography.
Mössbauer spectroscopy involves recoilless nuclear resonance absorption (commonly for Fe and Sn), not vibrational IR absorption.

***

9) A primary reason GC is generally unsuitable for many ionic salts compared to HPLC is that GC typically requires analytes to be:
A. Non-volatile and strongly solvated in water  
B. Volatile and thermally stable under column/injector conditions  
C. Strongly paramagnetic  
D. Capable of nuclear recoil-free gamma absorption  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: GC separation depends on volatilizing the sample and transporting it in a carrier gas through a column, so volatility and thermal stability are crucial.
HPLC can handle many non-volatile or thermally labile analytes because separation occurs in the liquid phase under pressure.
Paramagnetism is relevant to ESR, not chromatographic suitability.
Recoilless gamma absorption is the Mössbauer effect and has no role in GC/HPLC separations.

***

10) Which pair of technique–measured quantity is correctly matched?
A. TGA – mass change with temperature; ISE – EMF related to ion activity (via Nernst-type dependence)  
B. DSC – mass change with temperature; ISE – chromatographic retention time  
C. DTA – molecular ion m/z values; CV – crystal lattice plane spacing  
D. Polarography – X-ray diffraction intensity pattern; FTIR – electron spin transitions  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: TGA tracks sample mass as temperature changes, making it ideal for studying decomposition steps and thermal stability.
Ion-selective electrodes measure a potential (EMF) that depends on ion activity/concentration, commonly interpreted using Nernst-type relationships for potentiometry.
DSC measures heat flow (not mass), while retention time is a chromatography metric rather than an ISE output.
Assigning molecular-ion m/z to DTA, lattice spacing to CV, diffraction patterns to polarography, or electron-spin transitions to FTIR confuses fundamentally different instrumental principles.
