1) A white solid \(\mathrm{A}\) reacts with water to give a strongly basic solution and a gas \(\mathrm{B}\). The gas \(\mathrm{B}\) burns in oxygen, and the resulting product dissolves in water to give an acid \(\mathrm{C}\). The acid \(\mathrm{C}\) is significantly stronger when it contains more oxygen atoms bound to the same central atom. Which identification set is most consistent with these observations?
A. \(\mathrm{A}\) = ionic hydride; \(\mathrm{B}\) = \(\mathrm{H_2}\); \(\mathrm{C}\) = an oxoacid whose strength increases with oxidation state/oxygen count  
B. \(\mathrm{A}\) = covalent hydride; \(\mathrm{B}\) = \(\mathrm{NH_3}\); \(\mathrm{C}\) = amphoteric oxide in water  
C. \(\mathrm{A}\) = acidic oxide; \(\mathrm{B}\) = \(\mathrm{CO_2}\); \(\mathrm{C}\) = ionic nitride hydrolysis product  
D. \(\mathrm{A}\) = neutral oxide; \(\mathrm{B}\) = \(\mathrm{O_2}\); \(\mathrm{C}\) = hydrogen halide whose acidity increases with oxygen atoms  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Ionic hydrides contain \(\mathrm{H^-}\) and typically react with water to produce hydroxide (basic solution) and hydrogen gas, matching \(\mathrm{A \rightarrow B}\).
Hydrogen combustion yields water, and subsequent “acid \(\mathrm{C}\)” points to an additional step: the scenario is designed to test integration with oxoacid acidity trends (acid strength increasing with oxygen count/oxidation state for a given central atom).
Covalent hydrides do not generally yield strongly basic solution by direct hydrolysis in the same “salt-like hydride” sense, and \(\mathrm{NH_3}\) does not match “burns in oxygen” to give an oxoacid trend statement.
A hydrogen halide cannot “contain more oxygen atoms” (that describes oxoacids, not binary hydrogen halides), so that option contradicts oxoacid structure–property rules.

2) Two covalent halides \(\mathrm{ECl_3}\) and \(\mathrm{ECl_4}\) are compared for hydrolysis in water. \(\mathrm{ECl_3}\) hydrolyzes more vigorously and acts as a stronger Lewis acid than \(\mathrm{ECl_4}\). Which reasoning best supports this difference?
A. \(\mathrm{ECl_3}\) is more electron-deficient at E and more able to accept lone pairs from water, enhancing hydrolysis  
B. \(\mathrm{ECl_4}\) must be ionic, so it cannot hydrolyze at all  
C. Hydrolysis depends only on the number of chloride atoms, so \(\mathrm{ECl_4}\) must hydrolyze faster  
D. Lewis acidity decreases as covalency increases, so the more covalent halide must hydrolyze least  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The halide section links hydrolysis trends to Lewis acidity of halides; a more electron-deficient central atom accepts electron density from water more readily, accelerating hydrolysis.
Being \(\mathrm{ECl_4}\) does not automatically make the compound ionic; ionic vs covalent character depends on bonding and polarization arguments, not formula alone.
Hydrolysis rate is not controlled only by the count of halogens; the mechanism depends on electrophilicity/Lewis acidity, structure, and bonding.
Greater covalent character does not automatically mean lower Lewis acidity; in many p-block halides, covalent yet electron-deficient species are strong Lewis acids and hydrolyze readily.

3) A binary oxide \(\mathrm{E_xO_y}\) exists in multiple polymorphs and also forms a slightly non-stoichiometric solid with mixed oxidation states of E. Which combined statement best connects these two observations to main-group oxide chemistry themes?
A. Polymorphism reflects different crystal structures, while non-stoichiometry often signals mixed valence in solids  
B. Polymorphism occurs only in molecular oxides, and non-stoichiometry occurs only in oxoacids  
C. Polymorphism implies the oxide must be amphoteric, and non-stoichiometry implies it must be neutral  
D. Mixed valence rules out any possibility of phase transitions or polymorphs  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The oxide content explicitly treats polymorphism/phase transitions as structural phenomena in solids and separately highlights mixed-valence/non-stoichiometric oxides as a common solid-state feature.
Molecular oxides are not the only class that can show polymorphism, and oxoacids are a different compound class than binary oxides.
Acidic/basic/amphoteric classification is about acid–base behavior and does not by itself force polymorphism or non-stoichiometry assignments.
Mixed valence does not prevent polymorph formation; both can coexist as solid-state behaviors.

4) An unknown compound \(\mathrm{X}\) is a main-group nitride that hydrolyzes readily to give ammonia. Another nitride \(\mathrm{Y}\) is extremely resistant to hydrolysis and is best described as a network solid. Which paired classification is most consistent?
A. \(\mathrm{X}\) = ionic nitride; \(\mathrm{Y}\) = covalent/network nitride  
B. \(\mathrm{X}\) = covalent nitride; \(\mathrm{Y}\) = ionic nitride  
C. \(\mathrm{X}\) = interstitial nitride; \(\mathrm{Y}\) = oxoacid derivative  
D. \(\mathrm{X}\) = metallic hydride; \(\mathrm{Y}\) = amphoteric oxide  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The nitride section highlights hydrolysis of ionic nitrides (via strongly basic \(\mathrm{N^{3-}}\)) and contrasts them with covalent/network nitrides that exhibit high stability and reduced hydrolysis reactivity.
Swapping these assignments contradicts the reactivity–bonding correlation emphasized for nitride classes.
Oxoacids and hydrides are different compound families and do not classify nitrides in the given framework.
The option mixing unrelated classes fails to connect to nitride classification principles.

5) A sulfur-containing solid \(\mathrm{S}\) is oxidized to give an oxide, which in turn can yield an oxoacid on hydration. The solid \(\mathrm{S}\) also shows disproportionation behavior under certain conditions. Which statement best integrates the “sulfides → oxides/oxoacids” pathway with redox/disproportionation ideas?
A. Sulfides can participate in redox chemistry; oxidation can convert sulfides to oxides and further to oxoacids, and disproportionation reflects sulfur’s accessible oxidation-state chemistry  
B. Sulfides are redox-inert, so oxidation to oxides/oxoacids is not expected; any observed changes must be physical only  
C. Disproportionation is exclusive to halides, so sulfur compounds cannot show it  
D. Formation of oxoacids from sulfur compounds cannot involve oxidation states, only hydrogen bonding  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The sulfide section explicitly connects sulfides to hydrolysis/redox behavior and mentions oxidation to oxides and oxoacids, while also listing disproportionation as a relevant redox pattern.
Calling sulfides redox-inert contradicts the “redox chemistry of main group elements” and sulfide reactivity themes.
Disproportionation is not exclusive to halides; it is treated as a general redox concept relevant across main-group compound classes.
Oxoacid formation and stability trends depend strongly on oxidation state and bonding/structure, not only on hydrogen bonding.
