Question: An unknown main-group binary compound ECl₃ is (i) covalent in the vapor phase, (ii) strongly Lewis acidic, and (iii) hydrolyzes vigorously in moist air. Which inference about E is most consistent with these observations?
Options:
- E is an electron-deficient Group 13 element; ECl₃ tends to have an incomplete octet and thus high Lewis acidity.
- E is an alkali metal; ECl₃ is an ionic salt and hydrolyzes because chloride is a strong base.
- E is a noble gas; ECl₃ is stable and inert, so hydrolysis is due to water autoionization only.
- E is a late p-block element; ECl₃ must be non-Lewis-acidic because E already has an octet.
Correct answer: E is an electron-deficient Group 13 element; ECl₃ tends to have an incomplete octet and thus high Lewis acidity.
Explanation: The halides unit emphasizes that many covalent halides act as Lewis acids and show strong hydrolysis trends when the central atom is electron-poor.  A classic structural reason is incomplete octet/electron deficiency (typical of Group 13 trihalides), which makes the central atom electrophilic toward water, driving hydrolysis.  The alkali-metal option is wrong because stable “MCl₃” for alkali metals is not chemically consistent with their +1 chemistry, and chloride is not a strong base that explains vigorous hydrolysis.  The noble-gas option is inconsistent with the syllabus-level bonding/stoichiometry expectations and contradicts the observed reactivity.  The “late p-block must be non-Lewis-acidic” claim is an overgeneralization; Lewis acidity depends on electron deficiency/acceptor ability and not merely “having an octet” in a simplistic count.

Question: Which reasoning best explains why some main-group oxides can show redox flexibility and non-stoichiometry, while many simple ionic oxides do not?
Options:
- Variable oxidation states and defect structures can be accommodated in certain oxide lattices, enabling mixed-valence/non-stoichiometric compositions.
- Oxygen always stays at oxidation state −2 in all oxides, so redox flexibility is impossible by definition.
- Non-stoichiometry occurs only in molecular oxides because solids cannot have defects.
- Redox flexibility is determined only by the boiling point of the oxide, not by bonding/structure.
Correct answer: Variable oxidation states and defect structures can be accommodated in certain oxide lattices, enabling mixed-valence/non-stoichiometric compositions.
Explanation: The oxides topic explicitly includes “mixed valence and non-stoichiometric oxides” and links oxide behavior to structure and redox properties.  In solids, lattice defects and variable oxidation states can allow charge balance without strict integer stoichiometry, which is why some oxide frameworks can support redox activity and composition ranges.  The claim that oxygen is always −2 ignores peroxide/superoxide chemistry and also ignores that redox processes can involve the central element’s oxidation state changes.  The statement that solids cannot have defects contradicts the “crystal structure and polymorphism” and non-stoichiometry concepts in the unit.  Boiling point alone is not a mechanistic descriptor for redox flexibility; bonding and electronic structure control oxidation-state accessibility.

Question: Consider the hydrolysis behavior across compound classes. Which statement best integrates bonding character, Lewis acidity, and observed hydrolysis trends for main-group hydrides vs halides?
Options:
- Covalent halides hydrolyze mainly because the central atom can be Lewis acidic (electrophilic), whereas many ionic hydrides react with water mainly due to the basic character of \( \text{H}^- \).
- Both covalent halides and ionic hydrides hydrolyze for the same reason: halide ions and hydride ions are equally strong bases.
- Hydrolysis trends are controlled only by molecular geometry (VSEPR), independent of electronegativity and bonding type.
- Hydrides never react with water because hydrogen is already fully reduced.
Correct answer: Covalent halides hydrolyze mainly because the central atom can be Lewis acidic (electrophilic), whereas many ionic hydrides react with water mainly due to the basic character of \( \text{H}^- \).
Explanation: The learning path includes hydrolysis trends (cross-compound comparison), bonding-type classification, and Lewis acidity of halides as linked ideas.  Many covalent halides hydrolyze through nucleophilic attack of water at an electrophilic central atom (Lewis-acid behavior), while ionic hydrides often react because \( \text{H}^- \) is a strong base that abstracts protons from water to form \( \text{H}_2 \) and hydroxide.  Treating halide ions as equally basic as hydride is incorrect because halide ions are much weaker bases in water than \( \text{H}^- \), and their behavior is not the primary driver in typical covalent halide hydrolysis.  Geometry can influence approach and sterics, but the unit stresses periodic trends, electronegativity, and bonding as central drivers of stability/reactivity.  The claim “hydrides never react with water” directly contradicts the unit’s hydride reactivity focus.

Question: A main-group molecule has formula AX₃E₂ (A is central atom, X are identical ligands, E denotes lone pairs). Which shape best matches VSEPR predictions and why is it considered a “deviation from ideal geometry”?
Options:
- T-shaped; lone pairs occupy equatorial positions in a trigonal-bipyramidal electron-domain arrangement, distorting ideal angles.
- Trigonal planar; lone pairs do not affect shape because they are not atoms.
- Tetrahedral; five electron domains always produce tetrahedral geometry.
- Square planar; five electron domains always become square planar to minimize repulsion.
Correct answer: T-shaped; lone pairs occupy equatorial positions in a trigonal-bipyramidal electron-domain arrangement, distorting ideal angles.
Explanation: The unit explicitly covers VSEPR principles, geometries with lone pairs, and deviations from ideal geometries as a related concept.  For five electron domains (AX₃E₂), the electron-pair geometry is trigonal bipyramidal, but the molecular geometry becomes T-shaped because lone pairs repel more strongly and preferentially occupy equatorial positions, compressing bond angles relative to the “ideal” trigonal-bipyramidal angles.  Trigonal planar ignores the presence of two lone pairs and the five-domain count.  Tetrahedral is associated with four electron domains, not five.  Square planar is typically derived from six electron domains (octahedral electron arrangement) with two lone pairs opposite, not from five electron domains.

Question: Which statement most accurately connects oxoacid structure (bonding/resonance), oxidation state, and acidity trends for a series of oxoacids of the same central atom?
Options:
- Increasing number of terminal (=O) type oxygens generally stabilizes the conjugate base via electron withdrawal/resonance distribution, increasing acidity.
- Acidity decreases as the oxidation state increases because higher oxidation states always hold electrons more tightly and resist deprotonation.
- Acidity depends only on the number of hydrogen atoms; oxygen count and bonding are irrelevant.
- All oxoacids of the same element have identical acidity because the central atom identity alone fixes pKa.
Correct answer: Increasing number of terminal (=O) type oxygens generally stabilizes the conjugate base via electron withdrawal/resonance distribution, increasing acidity.
Explanation: The oxoacids topic emphasizes structure–property relationships, Pauling-type structural reasoning, resonance effects, and oxidation-state/electronegativity factors controlling acid strength trends.  Adding more oxygen atoms (often increasing oxidation state) increases electron withdrawal from the O–H bond and stabilizes the conjugate base by delocalizing negative charge over more oxygens, which strengthens the acid.  The “acidity decreases with oxidation state” statement contradicts the standard trend highlighted in the unit’s acid-strength factors.  Counting hydrogens alone fails because two acids with the same number of H can differ strongly in pKa due to different numbers/arrangements of oxygens and resonance stabilization.  Assuming identical acidity ignores the explicitly stated goal of comparing pKa trends across oxoacids.
