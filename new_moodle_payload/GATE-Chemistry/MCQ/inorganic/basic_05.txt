## Part 1: Basic (10 MCQs)

1) In the complex \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}] \mathrm{Cl_3}\), which species are the counterions (outside the coordination sphere)?
- \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}]^{3+}\)
- \(\mathrm{NH_3}\)
- \(\mathrm{Cl^-}\)
- \(\mathrm{Co^{3+}}\)

Correct answer: \(\mathrm{Cl^-}\)

Explanation: Counterions are ions that balance charge but are not directly bonded to the metal inside the coordination sphere.  In \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}] \mathrm{Cl_3}\), the three chloride ions are outside the bracket, so they are counterions.  The bracketed \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}]^{3+}\) is the complex (coordination entity), not a counterion.  \(\mathrm{NH_3}\) are ligands inside the coordination sphere, not counterions.  \(\mathrm{Co^{3+}}\) is the central metal ion within the complex, not a counterion.

2) The coordination number of a metal in a complex is best defined as:
- The number of donor atoms directly bonded to the metal center
- The total charge on the complex ion
- The number of ligands present, regardless of denticity
- The oxidation state of the metal ion

Correct answer: The number of donor atoms directly bonded to the metal center

Explanation: Coordination number counts metal–donor atom bonds, so a bidentate ligand contributes 2 to coordination number.  Total charge is a separate property determined by oxidation state and ligand charges.  Counting ligands “regardless of denticity” fails for chelates (for example, one bidentate ligand would be counted as one ligand but contributes two donor atoms).  Oxidation state is an electron-counting/charge concept and does not directly equal coordination number.

3) A common geometry for coordination number 6 in transition-metal complexes is:
- Octahedral
- Trigonal planar
- Square planar
- Linear

Correct answer: Octahedral

Explanation: Six-coordinate transition-metal complexes most commonly adopt octahedral geometry.  Trigonal planar is typical for coordination number 3, not 6.  Square planar is common for coordination number 4 (especially d⁸ metals like Pt(II)), not 6.  Linear geometry is typically coordination number 2.

4) The pair \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_5NO_2}]^{2+}\) (nitro) and \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_5ONO}]^{2+}\) (nitrito) illustrates which type of isomerism?
- Linkage isomerism
- Geometric isomerism
- Ionisation isomerism
- Optical isomerism

Correct answer: Linkage isomerism

Explanation: Linkage isomerism arises when an ambidentate ligand binds through different donor atoms (here \(\mathrm{NO_2^-}\) binds via N or O).  Geometric isomerism involves different spatial arrangements (cis/trans, fac/mer) without changing the binding atom of a ligand.  Ionisation isomerism involves exchange between a ligand in the coordination sphere and a counterion.  Optical isomerism requires non-superimposable mirror images (chirality), which is not the key feature here.

5) Which complex can show cis–trans (geometric) isomerism in a square-planar arrangement?
- \([\mathrm{Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2}]\)
- \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}]^{3+}\)
- \([\mathrm{Ni(CO)_4}]\)
- \([\mathrm{ZnCl_4}]^{2-}\)

Correct answer: \([\mathrm{Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2}]\)

Explanation: Square-planar complexes of the form \([\mathrm{MA_2B_2}]\) can exist as cis and trans isomers.  \([\mathrm{Co(NH_3)_6}]^{3+}\) is octahedral with all identical ligands, so no geometric isomerism occurs.  \([\mathrm{Ni(CO)_4}]\) is tetrahedral with identical ligands, so cis/trans is not possible.  \([\mathrm{ZnCl_4}]^{2-}\) is tetrahedral with identical ligands, so cis/trans is not defined.

6) In Valence Bond Theory (VBT), an “inner-orbital” octahedral complex is associated with:
- Use of \((n-1)d\) orbitals in hybridisation (often low-spin for strong-field ligands)
- Use of \(nd\) orbitals in hybridisation (always high-spin)
- No hybridisation concept is used in describing complexes
- Square-planar geometry for coordination number 6

Correct answer: Use of \((n-1)d\) orbitals in hybridisation (often low-spin for strong-field ligands)

Explanation: VBT describes inner-orbital octahedral complexes via \(d^2sp^3\) hybridisation using \((n-1)d\) orbitals, commonly linked with electron pairing in strong fields.  Using \(nd\) orbitals corresponds to “outer-orbital” \(sp^3d^2\) description and is not “always high-spin” as a universal rule in the way stated.  VBT explicitly uses hybridisation ideas, so denying hybridisation contradicts the model’s assumptions.  Coordination number 6 is typically octahedral rather than square planar.

7) In an octahedral crystal field, which d-orbital set lies at higher energy?
- \(e_g\) set \((d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{z^2})\)
- \(t_{2g}\) set \((d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz})\)
- All five d orbitals remain degenerate
- The ordering depends only on oxidation state, not geometry

Correct answer: \(e_g\) set \((d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{z^2})\)

Explanation: In octahedral fields, ligands approach along axes, increasing repulsion for \(d_{x^2-y^2}\) and \(d_{z^2}\), making the \(e_g\) set higher in energy than \(t_{2g}\).  The \(t_{2g}\) orbitals point between axes and experience less repulsion, so they are lower in energy.  Degeneracy is broken in a crystal field, so “all five remain degenerate” is incorrect for octahedral splitting.  Oxidation state can affect the magnitude of splitting, but the basic ordering is determined by geometry (octahedral vs tetrahedral vs square planar).

8) Jahn–Teller distortion is most strongly associated with octahedral complexes having:
- A degenerate electronic ground state such as \(d^9\) (or high-spin \(d^4\))
- Completely filled d orbitals \(d^{10}\)
- No electrons in d orbitals \(d^0\)
- Only \(d^3\) configurations in any field strength

Correct answer: A degenerate electronic ground state such as \(d^9\) (or high-spin \(d^4\))

Explanation: Jahn–Teller distortion occurs when electronic degeneracy allows stabilization by lowering symmetry, and classic strong cases include octahedral \(d^9\) and high-spin \(d^4\).  \(d^{10}\) and \(d^0\) have no uneven occupancy of degenerate orbitals in the same way, so they generally do not show strong Jahn–Teller effects.  \(d^3\) in octahedral fields typically gives a more symmetric occupancy pattern in \(t_{2g}\), so it is not the “most strongly associated” case.

9) In many octahedral complexes with a center of symmetry, d–d absorption bands are weak mainly because:
- They are Laporte-forbidden in centrosymmetric environments
- They are always spin-forbidden for any dⁿ configuration
- They involve charge-transfer rather than d–d transitions
- They require ligand dissociation before absorption can occur

Correct answer: They are Laporte-forbidden in centrosymmetric environments

Explanation: The Laporte selection rule makes \(d \rightarrow d\) transitions symmetry-forbidden in centrosymmetric complexes, so the bands are weak (though vibronic coupling can relax this).  Spin selection rules can forbid some transitions, but many d–d transitions are spin-allowed, so “always spin-forbidden” is incorrect.  Charge-transfer bands are a different class of transitions and are often much more intense than d–d bands, not the reason d–d bands are weak.  Ligand dissociation is not required for an electronic transition in UV–Vis spectroscopy.

10) Which statement best distinguishes kinetic stability from thermodynamic stability in coordination compounds?
- Kinetic stability concerns reaction rate (lability/inertness), while thermodynamic stability concerns equilibrium preference (overall free-energy favorability).
- Kinetic stability depends only on ionic radius, while thermodynamic stability depends only on colour.
- Kinetic stability and thermodynamic stability always increase together for all complexes.
- Thermodynamic stability refers to magnetic moment, while kinetic stability refers to oxidation state.

Correct answer: Kinetic stability concerns reaction rate (lability/inertness), while thermodynamic stability concerns equilibrium preference (overall free-energy favorability).

Explanation: Kinetic stability is about how fast ligand substitution/redox occurs (inert vs labile behavior), while thermodynamic stability is about how favorable a complex is at equilibrium.  Ionic radius and colour can correlate with some properties, but they do not define kinetic vs thermodynamic stability.  A complex can be thermodynamically stable yet kinetically labile (or vice versa), so they do not always increase together.  Magnetism and oxidation state may influence stability trends, but they do not constitute the definition of thermodynamic vs kinetic stability.
