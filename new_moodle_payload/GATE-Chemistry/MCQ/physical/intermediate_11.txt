1) For the Lindemann–Hinshelwood unimolecular mechanism  
\(A + M \xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_1} A^* + M\), \(A^* \xrightarrow{k_2} P\),  
applying steady-state approximation to \(A^*\), the observed first-order rate constant \(k_{\text{obs}}\) (defined by rate \(=k_{\text{obs}}[A]\)) is:
A. \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\)  
B. \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_{-1}k_2[M]}{k_1[M]+k_2}\)  
C. \(k_{\text{obs}}=k_1k_2[M]\)  
D. \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_2}{k_1[M]}\)  

Correct answer: \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\)  

Explanation: Using steady state for the energized intermediate, \(d[A^*]/dt\approx 0=k_1[A][M]-k_{-1}[A^*][M]-k_2[A^*]\).  Solving gives \([A^*]=\dfrac{k_1[A][M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\), and the product formation rate is \(v=k_2[A^*]=\dfrac{k_1k_2[A][M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\), hence \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\).  Option B swaps forward/backward activation incorrectly, giving wrong pressure behavior.  Option C corresponds to a low-pressure approximation but misses the denominator term that causes fall-off and saturation.  Option D inverts the dependence and predicts the rate decreases with pressure, contradicting Lindemann pressure-regime behavior.

2) From the expression \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\), the correct high-pressure limiting rate constant \(k_\infty\) is:
A. \(k_\infty=\dfrac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\)  
B. \(k_\infty=k_1[M]\)  
C. \(k_\infty=k_2[M]\)  
D. \(k_\infty=\dfrac{k_{-1}}{k_1}\)  

Correct answer: \(k_\infty=\dfrac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\)  

Explanation: At high pressure, \(k_{-1}[M]\gg k_2\), so \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx \dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]}=\dfrac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\), which is independent of \([M]\) and defines the high-pressure limit \(k_\infty\).  Option B is the high-pressure behavior for the activation step alone, not the effective unimolecular decomposition constant.  Option C incorrectly makes the limiting constant proportional to \([M]\), contradicting the pressure-independent saturation limit.  Option D is a ratio of activation/deactivation constants and does not represent the limiting unimolecular rate constant.

3) From \(k_{\text{obs}}=\dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_{-1}[M]+k_2}\), the correct low-pressure limiting form \(k_0[M]\) (i.e., \(k_{\text{obs}}\propto [M]\)) is:
A. \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx k_1[M]\)  
B. \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx \dfrac{k_1k_2}{k_{-1}}\)  
C. \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx \dfrac{k_{-1}}{k_1}[M]\)  
D. \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx \dfrac{k_2}{[M]}\)  

Correct answer: \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx k_1[M]\)  

Explanation: At low pressure, \(k_{-1}[M]\ll k_2\), so \(k_{\text{obs}}\approx \dfrac{k_1k_2[M]}{k_2}=k_1[M]\), giving the linear pressure dependence typical of the low-pressure regime.  Option B is the high-pressure limit and therefore fails to show the linear dependence on \([M]\).  Option C misplaces constants and does not emerge from the low-pressure approximation.  Option D predicts an inverse pressure dependence, opposite to Lindemann activation control at low pressures.

4) In Transition State Theory, if the activation free energy increases by \(RT\ln 10\) at a fixed temperature, the rate constant changes by a factor of:
A. Decreases by 10 times  
B. Increases by 10 times  
C. Decreases by \(e\) times  
D. No change (rate depends only on \(\Delta H^\ddagger\))  

Correct answer: Decreases by 10 times  

Explanation: TST relates the rate constant to the free energy of activation \(\Delta G^\ddagger\), so \(k\propto \exp(-\Delta G^\ddagger/RT)\).  If \(\Delta G^\ddagger\) increases by \(RT\ln 10\), then \(k\) is multiplied by \(\exp(-\ln 10)=1/10\), meaning it decreases tenfold.  An increase by 10 would require \(\Delta G^\ddagger\) to decrease by \(RT\ln 10\), not increase.  The factor \(e\) corresponds to a change of \(RT\), not \(RT\ln 10\).  The rate is not governed only by \(\Delta H^\ddagger\); \(\Delta S^\ddagger\) contributes via \(\Delta G^\ddagger\).

5) The Eyring–Polanyi form used to extract activation enthalpy and entropy is most directly obtained by rearranging TST into a linear plot of:
A. \(\ln(k/T)\) versus \(1/T\)  
B. \(\ln k\) versus \(T\)  
C. \(k\) versus \(1/T\)  
D. \(\ln(kT)\) versus \(1/T\)  

Correct answer: \(\ln(k/T)\) versus \(1/T\)  

Explanation: Activation thermodynamics in TST uses an Eyring–Polanyi relationship where \(\ln(k/T)\) varies linearly with \(1/T\), allowing extraction of activation enthalpy and entropy from slope and intercept.  A plot of \(\ln k\) versus \(1/T\) is characteristic of Arrhenius analysis, not the standard Eyring–Polanyi linearization highlighted for activation parameters.  Plotting \(\ln k\) versus \(T\) is not linear for these models over typical ranges.  Using \(\ln(kT)\) changes the algebra and does not match the conventional extraction method described for \(\Delta H^\ddagger\) and \(\Delta S^\ddagger\).

6) Consider two competing unimolecular pathways from the same reactant with \(\Delta G_1^\ddagger < \Delta G_2^\ddagger\) at temperature \(T\). Under TST assumptions, the ratio \(k_1/k_2\) is:
A. \(k_1/k_2=\exp\!\left(-(\Delta G_1^\ddagger-\Delta G_2^\ddagger)/RT\right)\)  
B. \(k_1/k_2=\exp\!\left((\Delta G_1^\ddagger-\Delta G_2^\ddagger)/RT\right)\)  
C. \(k_1/k_2=(\Delta G_2^\ddagger/\Delta G_1^\ddagger)\)  
D. \(k_1/k_2=(T_1/T_2)\)  

Correct answer: \(k_1/k_2=\exp\!\left(-(\Delta G_1^\ddagger-\Delta G_2^\ddagger)/RT\right)\)  

Explanation: Since TST gives \(k\propto \exp(-\Delta G^\ddagger/RT)\), dividing gives \(k_1/k_2=\exp\left(-(\Delta G_1^\ddagger-\Delta G_2^\ddagger)/RT\right)\).  With \(\Delta G_1^\ddagger<\Delta G_2^\ddagger\), the exponent is positive and \(k_1>k_2\), consistent with the lower barrier leading to the faster channel.  Option B flips the sign and would incorrectly predict the higher-barrier path is faster.  Option C is not a TST relationship and ignores exponential sensitivity to barrier height.  Option D is irrelevant because both rate constants are at the same temperature here.

7) A computed stationary point on a PES has all positive Hessian eigenvalues. This point must correspond to:
A. A minimum (stable intermediate/reactant/product geometry)  
B. A first-order saddle point (transition state)  
C. A second-order saddle point  
D. A point on the intrinsic reaction coordinate with one imaginary frequency  

Correct answer: A minimum (stable intermediate/reactant/product geometry)  

Explanation: Stationary-point characterization uses Hessian eigenvalues: all positive eigenvalues indicate positive curvature in every direction, which corresponds to a local minimum on the PES.  A transition state (first-order saddle) requires exactly one negative eigenvalue (one unstable direction).  A second-order saddle would require two negative eigenvalues, not none.  Points on an IRC are not generally stationary points (gradient not necessarily zero) and the “one imaginary frequency” criterion is specifically for transition states, not generic IRC points.

8) In classical trajectory analysis on a PES, the force on nuclei used to propagate motion is obtained from:
A. The negative gradient of the potential energy with respect to coordinates  
B. The potential energy itself (force equals energy)  
C. The positive gradient of the kinetic energy with respect to coordinates  
D. Only the Hessian matrix at the transition state  

Correct answer: The negative gradient of the potential energy with respect to coordinates  

Explanation: Classical trajectories propagate nuclei using Newton’s equations, where forces are obtained from the PES via \( \mathbf{F} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{R})\).  Potential energy is a scalar and does not directly equal force; force depends on how energy changes with coordinates.  Kinetic energy gradients with respect to coordinates do not define conservative forces for PES-driven dynamics.  The Hessian at a single point provides local curvature information, but trajectory propagation requires forces (gradients) along the whole path.

9) A key conceptual link between the reaction coordinate mode at a transition state and frequency analysis is that:
A. The reaction coordinate corresponds to the normal mode with an imaginary frequency  
B. The reaction coordinate always corresponds to the highest real vibrational frequency  
C. The reaction coordinate is unrelated to normal modes and cannot be inferred from them  
D. The reaction coordinate is the translational mode of the whole molecule  

Correct answer: The reaction coordinate corresponds to the normal mode with an imaginary frequency  

Explanation: For a first-order saddle point, the unstable direction along which the system proceeds toward products or back to reactants appears as an imaginary frequency in the normal-mode (Hessian) analysis.  The highest real vibrational frequency usually corresponds to a stiff bond stretch, not the barrier-crossing direction.  Normal-mode analysis is explicitly used to interpret the transition state and identify the reaction coordinate mode.  Overall translation is a zero-frequency motion, not the defining unstable mode of a transition state.

10) In comparing Arrhenius and Eyring viewpoints for activated processes, the “activation energy” concept most closely corresponds (in a qualitative mapping) to which TST barrier descriptor?
A. Free energy of activation \(\Delta G^\ddagger\)  
B. Enthalpy/energy barrier associated with reaching the transition state (linked to activation enthalpy)  
C. Entropy of reaction \(\Delta S\)  
D. Heat capacity change \(\Delta C_p\)  

Correct answer: Enthalpy/energy barrier associated with reaching the transition state (linked to activation enthalpy)  

Explanation: The unit highlights “activation energy” as the energy difference between reactants and the transition state and notes the Arrhenius vs Eyring descriptions, where TST interprets the barrier using activation thermodynamic quantities.  Arrhenius’ \(E_a\) is not directly the same as \(\Delta G^\ddagger\) because \(\Delta G^\ddagger=\Delta H^\ddagger - T\Delta S^\ddagger\) includes entropy effects that can strongly influence rates.  Entropy of reaction is about overall thermodynamics, not the kinetic barrier crossing.  Heat capacity changes are not the central barrier descriptor in the basic Arrhenius–Eyring comparison emphasized here.
