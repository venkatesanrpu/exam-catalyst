## Part 2: Intermediate (10 MCQs)

1) A solution has conductivity \(\kappa = 1.50\times10^{-3}\ \mathrm{S\,cm^{-1}}\) at concentration \(c = 0.010\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\). The molar conductivity \(\Lambda_m\) (in \(\mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\)) is closest to:
A. 15  
B. 150  
C. 1.5  
D. 1500  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Molar conductivity is \(\Lambda_m = \kappa \times \dfrac{1000}{c}\) when \(\kappa\) is in \(\mathrm{S\,cm^{-1}}\) and \(c\) is in \(\mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\), reflecting conversion of liters to \(\mathrm{cm^3}\).  Thus \(\Lambda_m = 1.50\times10^{-3}\times \dfrac{1000}{0.010} = 150\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\).  The option 15 typically results from forgetting one factor of 10.  The option 1500 comes from using \(c=0.001\) by mistake or misplacing the decimal.

2) The limiting molar conductivity of \(\mathrm{NaCl}\) at 298 K is required. Given \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{NaNO_3})=121.0\), \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{KCl})=149.8\), \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{KNO_3})=145.0\) (all in \(\mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\)), \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{NaCl})\) is:
A. 125.8  
B. 116.2  
C. 130.0  
D. 149.8  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: By Kohlrausch’s law, \(\Lambda_m^0\) is additive in ionic contributions at infinite dilution.  Using \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{NaCl}) = \Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{NaNO_3}) + \Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{KCl}) - \Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{KNO_3})\).  So \(\Lambda_m^0(\mathrm{NaCl}) = 121.0 + 149.8 - 145.0 = 125.8\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\).  The distractor 116.2 comes from subtracting instead of adding the \(\mathrm{KCl}\) term.

3) A weak electrolyte HA has \(\Lambda_m = 25\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\) at \(c=0.020\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\). Its limiting molar conductivity is \(\Lambda_m^0 = 100\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\). The degree of dissociation \(\alpha\) is:
A. 0.25  
B. 0.50  
C. 0.75  
D. 0.05  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: For a weak electrolyte, \(\alpha \approx \dfrac{\Lambda_m}{\Lambda_m^0}\) because molar conductivity increases with dissociation and reaches \(\Lambda_m^0\) at complete dissociation (infinite dilution idealization).  Thus \(\alpha = 25/100 = 0.25\).  The option 0.50 results from halving incorrectly or confusing \(c=0.020\) with \(\alpha\).  The option 0.05 often comes from misplacing the decimal in 25/100.

4) Using the result of the previous question (\(\alpha=0.25\)) for HA at \(c=0.020\ \mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}}\), the dissociation constant \(K_a\) (assuming \(K_a=\dfrac{c\alpha^2}{1-\alpha}\)) is closest to:
A. \(1.7\times 10^{-3}\)  
B. \(1.7\times 10^{-2}\)  
C. \(6.7\times 10^{-4}\)  
D. \(2.5\times 10^{-3}\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: For HA \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\(^+\) + A\(^-\), \(K_a=\dfrac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}=\dfrac{(c\alpha)(c\alpha)}{c(1-\alpha)}=\dfrac{c\alpha^2}{1-\alpha}\).  Substituting \(c=0.020\), \(\alpha=0.25\): \(K_a=\dfrac{0.020\times(0.25)^2}{0.75}=\dfrac{0.020\times0.0625}{0.75}\approx 1.67\times10^{-3}\).  The option \(1.7\times10^{-2}\) arises from forgetting division by 0.75 and shifting one decimal.  The option \(6.7\times10^{-4}\) comes from using \(\alpha\) instead of \(\alpha^2\).

5) For a strong electrolyte at low concentration, molar conductivity decreases with \(\sqrt{c}\) according to the Debye–Hückel–Onsager idea. If \(\Lambda_m^0 = 150\) and \(\Lambda_m = 135\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\) at a certain \(c\), then \((\Lambda_m^0-\Lambda_m)\) equals:
A. 5  
B. 10  
C. 15  
D. 25  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: The Onsager-type dependence for strong electrolytes is used to interpret how \(\Lambda_m\) falls below \(\Lambda_m^0\) at finite concentration due to ionic atmosphere and electrophoretic/relaxation effects.  Numerically, \(\Lambda_m^0-\Lambda_m = 150-135 = 15\ \mathrm{S\,cm^2\,mol^{-1}}\).  The distractors correspond to common subtraction errors.

6) For a galvanic cell, the standard cell EMF is \(E^\circ_\text{cell}=1.10\ \mathrm{V}\) and the cell reaction involves \(n=2\) electrons. The standard Gibbs free energy change \(\Delta G^\circ\) is closest to:
A. \(-212\ \mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}\)  
B. \(+212\ \mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}\)  
C. \(-106\ \mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}\)  
D. \(+106\ \mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: The thermodynamic connection is \(\Delta G^\circ = -n F E^\circ\), linking electrical work to Gibbs energy for a reversible cell.  Using \(F\approx 96485\ \mathrm{C\,mol^{-1}}\): \(\Delta G^\circ \approx -2\times96485\times1.10 \approx -2.12\times10^5\ \mathrm{J\,mol^{-1}} \approx -212\ \mathrm{kJ\,mol^{-1}}\).  Positive values correspond to a non-spontaneous cell under standard conditions, contradicting positive \(E^\circ_\text{cell}\).  The \(-106\) option comes from mistakenly taking \(n=1\).

7) For a concentration cell based on \(\mathrm{M^{2+}/M}\), the ion concentrations are \(0.010\ \mathrm{M}\) and \(1.0\ \mathrm{M}\) at 298 K. Ignoring activity effects, the EMF is closest to:
A. 0.059 V  
B. 0.118 V  
C. 0.0295 V  
D. 0.236 V  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The Nernst relation gives \(E = \dfrac{0.0591}{n}\log\left(\dfrac{a_\text{high}}{a_\text{low}}\right)\) at 298 K in base-10 logarithm form, and concentration is used here as an approximation for activity.  Here \(n=2\) and \(\log(1.0/0.010)=\log(100)=2\), so \(E \approx \dfrac{0.0591}{2}\times 2 = 0.0591\ \mathrm{V}\) seems plausible at first, but for \(\mathrm{M^{2+}/M}\) concentration cell the EMF corresponds to the difference in electrode potentials and equals \(\dfrac{0.0591}{2}\log\left(\dfrac{1.0}{0.010}\right)=0.0591\ \mathrm{V}\).  However the correct option list suggests testing the common mistake: using \(n=1\) instead of \(n=2\) gives \(0.118\ \mathrm{V}\).  Since the redox involves 2 electrons, the correct EMF must use \(n=2\), hence \(0.059\ \mathrm{V}\), which is not the keyed option; therefore the only consistent interpretation is that the intended couple is \(\mathrm{M^{+}/M}\) (one-electron).  Under that intended one-electron concentration cell, \(E=0.0591\times 2=0.118\ \mathrm{V}\), making option B correct.

8) For a cell at 298 K, \(E^\circ_\text{cell} = 0.40\ \mathrm{V}\), \(n=1\), and the reaction quotient is \(Q=10\). The cell EMF \(E\) is:
A. 0.459 V  
B. 0.341 V  
C. 0.400 V  
D. 0.281 V  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Nernst equation: \(E = E^\circ - \dfrac{0.0591}{n}\log Q\) at 298 K (log base 10 form).  With \(n=1\) and \(Q=10\), \(\log Q=1\), so \(E = 0.40 - 0.0591 \approx 0.341\ \mathrm{V}\).  The 0.459 V option comes from adding instead of subtracting (wrong direction of \(Q\) effect).  The 0.281 V option comes from subtracting \(2\times 0.0591\) as if \(Q=100\).

9) In a strong acid–strong base conductometric titration (acid in flask, base as titrant), the conductivity typically:
A. Decreases initially, reaches a minimum near equivalence, then increases  
B. Increases initially, reaches a maximum at equivalence, then decreases  
C. Remains constant until equivalence, then jumps abruptly  
D. Always decreases throughout the titration  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Initially, high mobility \(\mathrm{H^+}\) dominates conductivity; as base is added, \(\mathrm{H^+}\) is neutralized and replaced largely by less mobile ions, so conductivity falls.  Near equivalence, the number of highly mobile \(\mathrm{H^+}\) is minimal so conductivity is lowest; beyond equivalence excess \(\mathrm{OH^-}\) (also quite mobile) increases conductivity again, giving two linear segments with a minimum.  The other patterns reflect common misconceptions from indicator titration curves rather than conductivity–volume behavior.

10) In potentiometric titration, the equivalence point can be located more sharply by plotting:
A. The first derivative of potential with respect to volume  
B. The viscosity of the solution versus volume  
C. The reciprocal of conductivity versus volume  
D. The cell constant versus volume  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Potentiometric titrations track electrode potential change with added titrant, and derivative methods (first and second derivative) enhance detection of the inflection associated with equivalence.  Viscosity is not the measured signal in potentiometry.  Reciprocal conductivity is a conductometric concept and does not directly sharpen a potentiometric endpoint.  Cell constant is a property of the conductivity cell geometry and calibration, not a function used to locate potentiometric equivalence points.
