1) In adsorption terminology, **physisorption** is best described as:

A. Formation of strong chemical bonds between adsorbate and surface  
B. Adsorption dominated by weak van der Waals interactions and generally reversible  
C. Adsorption that always forms a monolayer and reaches saturation at low pressure  
D. Adsorption that requires an activation energy comparable to bond dissociation energies  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Physisorption arises mainly from weak intermolecular forces (dispersion/van der Waals) between the surface and the adsorbate, so it is usually reversible and favored at lower temperatures.  Strong chemical-bond formation and higher activation barriers are hallmarks of chemisorption, not physisorption.  Monolayer saturation is a Langmuir-model feature and is not a defining requirement for physisorption.

***

2) Which feature most strongly indicates **chemisorption** rather than physisorption?

A. Low enthalpy of adsorption (small magnitude)  
B. Multilayer adsorption is common  
C. Strong, specific bonding to the surface with higher adsorption energy  
D. Adsorption is always easily reversible by mild heating  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Chemisorption involves formation of stronger chemical bonds between adsorbate and surface sites, leading to higher adsorption energies and often lower reversibility.  Low enthalpy and multilayer formation are more consistent with physisorption and multilayer models such as BET.  Easy reversibility is more typical of weakly bound (physical) adsorption.

***

3) The **Langmuir isotherm** is fundamentally based on which assumption set?

A. Heterogeneous surface with a distribution of adsorption energies and no saturation  
B. Monolayer adsorption on a uniform surface with a finite number of identical sites and no lateral interactions  
C. Multilayer adsorption where heat of adsorption is constant for all layers  
D. Empirical power-law dependence valid for all pressures and temperatures  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Langmuir model assumes a uniform surface, identical adsorption sites, monolayer coverage, and no interactions between adsorbed molecules, leading to saturation at full site occupancy.  Surface heterogeneity and energy distributions are tied to Freundlich-type behavior, not Langmuir.  Multilayer adsorption is treated by BET theory, not Langmuir.

***

4) The **Freundlich isotherm** is best characterized as:

A. A strictly derived kinetic-equilibrium model for monolayer adsorption on uniform sites  
B. An empirical power-law model often used for adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces over limited pressure ranges  
C. A multilayer adsorption model used to obtain monolayer capacity and surface area  
D. A mechanistic model for catalytic surface reactions between adsorbed species  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Freundlich isotherm is an empirical relationship (power-law type) commonly applied to heterogeneous surfaces and typically valid only over a limited pressure (or concentration) range.  Langmuir is the monolayer uniform-site model, and BET is the multilayer extension used for surface area estimation via monolayer capacity.  Catalytic surface reaction mechanisms are treated using models such as Langmuir–Hinshelwood, not Freundlich.

***

5) The **BET isotherm** is primarily used to:

A. Describe only monolayer adsorption on perfectly uniform surfaces  
B. Describe multilayer adsorption and estimate surface area via monolayer capacity  
C. Explain why adsorption occurs thermodynamically using surface excess concepts  
D. Model heterogeneous catalysis by deriving surface reaction rate laws  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: BET theory extends the Langmuir idea to multilayer adsorption and is widely used to determine surface area from the monolayer capacity obtained from adsorption data.  Thermodynamic driving force and surface excess concepts are treated under adsorption thermodynamics (e.g., Gibbs adsorption isotherm).  Rate-law modeling for heterogeneous catalysis is addressed by surface kinetics frameworks such as Langmuir–Hinshelwood.

***

6) In the **Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism**, the surface reaction step typically involves:

A. Reaction between species both adsorbed on the catalyst surface, followed by product desorption  
B. Reaction only in the gas phase with the surface acting as an inert support  
C. Reaction between an adsorbed species and a free gas-phase molecule without adsorption  
D. Multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation in pores  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Langmuir–Hinshelwood surface catalysis describes adsorption of reactants onto active sites, reaction between adsorbed species on the surface, and desorption of products.  A purely gas-phase reaction does not capture the defining surface-adsorption and surface-reaction steps.  Multilayer adsorption/capillary condensation is associated with adsorption isotherm behavior (e.g., BET/porous solids concepts), not the catalytic mechanism itself.

***

7) **Surface tension** is best defined as:

A. Resistance to flow in a fluid due to internal friction  
B. Energy required to increase surface area by one unit (surface free energy per unit area)  
C. Pressure difference across a curved surface always equal to atmospheric pressure  
D. A measure of how quickly molecules diffuse in solution  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Surface tension reflects the energetic cost (surface free energy per unit area) of creating additional interface area and arises from the imbalance of intermolecular forces at an interface.  Resistance to flow due to internal friction defines viscosity, not surface tension.  Diffusion relates to molecular transport but is not the definition of surface tension.

***

8) **Viscosity** of a fluid refers to:

A. The tendency of molecules to organize into micelles above a threshold concentration  
B. The resistance of a fluid to flow, arising from internal friction and molecular interactions  
C. The amount of adsorbate required to form a monolayer on a surface  
D. The fraction of surface covered by adsorbate at equilibrium  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Viscosity is the resistance to flow (internal friction) and depends on molecular interactions, temperature, pressure, and composition.  Micelle formation relates to surfactants and critical micelle concentration, while monolayer capacity and coverage relate to adsorption models and surface kinetics.

***

9) **Self-assembly** in surface and interface chemistry is:

A. Random clustering driven only by external stirring  
B. Spontaneous organization of molecules into ordered structures driven by intermolecular forces and thermodynamics  
C. Always an irreversible process requiring covalent bond formation  
D. A phenomenon restricted only to gas–solid adsorption systems  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Self-assembly is the spontaneous formation of ordered structures (e.g., monolayers, bilayers, higher-order assemblies) driven by intermolecular forces and overall free-energy minimization.  It does not require external stirring as the primary cause, nor does it require irreversible covalent bond formation.  Self-assembly occurs across many environments (solutions, interfaces, soft matter), not only gas–solid adsorption.

***

10) A **colloid** is best described as:

A. A system where particles are typically in the 1–1000 nm size range dispersed in a medium  
B. A perfectly homogeneous molecular solution with no dispersed phase  
C. A system that is always unstable and must immediately coagulate  
D. A system where surfactants cannot adsorb at interfaces  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Colloids are dispersions with particle sizes typically in the nanometer to sub-micrometer range (about 1–1000 nm), showing behaviors such as colloidal stability considerations and Brownian motion.  They are not necessarily homogeneous molecular solutions, and they can be stabilized (electrostatically/sterically) rather than being inherently forced to coagulate.  Surfactants commonly adsorb at interfaces and can strongly influence colloidal stability and micellization behavior.
