1) For \(\mathrm{N_2}\), the correct MO-based prediction is:
A. Bond order 3 and diamagnetic  
B. Bond order 2 and paramagnetic  
C. Bond order 1 and diamagnetic  
D. Bond order 3 and paramagnetic  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For \(\mathrm{N_2}\) (10 valence electrons), filling the appropriate period-2 homonuclear MO diagram gives 8 electrons in bonding MOs and 2 in antibonding MOs, so bond order \(=(8-2)/2=3\), consistent with a triple bond.  All electrons end up paired in this configuration, so \(\mathrm{N_2}\) is predicted to be diamagnetic.
Why the other options are wrong: A bond order of 2 corresponds to species like \(\mathrm{O_2}\) (with different filling and unpaired electrons), not \(\mathrm{N_2}\).  Bond order 1 would imply much weaker bonding than observed for \(\mathrm{N_2}\).  Paramagnetism requires unpaired electrons, which \(\mathrm{N_2}\) does not have in the standard MO filling.

2) Using MO theory, the bond order and magnetism of \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\) are:
A. Bond order \(2.5\), paramagnetic  
B. Bond order \(2.0\), diamagnetic  
C. Bond order \(1.5\), diamagnetic  
D. Bond order \(3.0\), diamagnetic  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: \(\mathrm{O_2}\) has two unpaired electrons in \(\pi^*\) antibonding orbitals; removing one electron to form \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\) decreases antibonding occupancy by 1, so bond order increases by \(0.5\) (from 2 to 2.5).  One unpaired electron remains in \(\pi^*\), so \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\) is still paramagnetic.
Why the other options are wrong: Bond order does not remain 2.0 after removing an antibonding electron; it increases.  Diamagnetism would require all electrons paired, which is not true for \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\).  Bond order 1.5 would correspond to adding antibonding electrons (or removing bonding ones), opposite to the formation of \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\) from \(\mathrm{O_2}\).  Bond order 3.0 would require a much larger reduction in antibonding occupancy than a single-electron ionization provides.

3) In the context of period-2 homonuclear diatomics, the main qualitative consequence of \(s\)–\(p\) mixing (orbital mixing) is:
A. It can change the relative energy ordering of \(\sigma(2p)\) and \(\pi(2p)\) MOs in lighter diatomics  
B. It makes antibonding orbitals always lower than bonding orbitals  
C. It eliminates the existence of \(\pi\) orbitals  
D. It forces all species to become paramagnetic  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The MO ordering in period-2 homonuclear diatomics depends on atomic number, and \(s\)–\(p\) mixing is specifically cited as affecting the ordering pattern of the 2p-derived \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\) levels in lighter members.  This affects how electrons fill the MOs and therefore influences predicted bond order and magnetic behavior trends.
Why the other options are wrong: Antibonding orbitals are not generally stabilized below bonding orbitals; bonding/antibonding splitting retains bonding lower in energy.  \(\pi\) orbitals do not disappear; they arise from lateral overlap and remain part of the MO set.  Magnetic behavior depends on whether unpaired electrons occur after filling, not on mixing alone.

4) Which change will definitely increase the bond order of a diatomic species, according to MO theory?
A. Removing one electron from an antibonding orbital (with bonding occupancy unchanged)  
B. Removing one electron from a bonding orbital (with antibonding occupancy unchanged)  
C. Adding one electron to an antibonding orbital  
D. Adding one electron equally to both bonding and antibonding orbitals  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Bond order is \((N_b-N_a)/2\); decreasing \(N_a\) by 1 while keeping \(N_b\) fixed increases bond order by \(0.5\).  This is the same logic used when comparing \(\mathrm{O_2}\) and \(\mathrm{O_2^+}\) (ionization from antibonding increases bond order).
Why the other options are wrong: Removing a bonding electron decreases \(N_b\) and thus lowers bond order.  Adding an antibonding electron increases \(N_a\) and lowers bond order.  Adding electrons to both bonding and antibonding orbitals keeps \(N_b-N_a\) unchanged, so bond order does not increase.

5) In heteronuclear diatomic MO theory, if atom X is much more electronegative than atom Y, the bonding MO is expected to be:
A. More weighted toward X (greater contribution from the lower-energy atomic orbital)  
B. Exactly 50–50 combination of X and Y atomic orbitals  
C. More weighted toward Y (greater contribution from the higher-energy atomic orbital)  
D. Always nonbonding  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In heteronuclear diatomics, atomic orbital energy differences lead to unequal mixing; the lower-energy (more electronegative) atom contributes more to the bonding MO, producing orbital polarization.  This asymmetry is directly linked to partial charges and molecular polarity/dipole behavior.
Why the other options are wrong: A 50–50 combination is characteristic of homonuclear cases with equal AO energies, not strongly heteronuclear ones.  The higher-energy AO contributes more to the antibonding MO, not typically to the bonding MO.  The bonding MO is not “always nonbonding”; it is bonding by construction (stabilized combination).

6) Which statement best explains why a heteronuclear diatomic molecule can have a permanent dipole moment within MO theory?
A. Asymmetric MO coefficients lead to unequal electron density distribution over the two atoms  
B. A permanent dipole arises only if the bond order is exactly 1  
C. Dipole moment is independent of electronegativity difference  
D. Dipole moment requires the presence of only \(\pi\) bonds  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In heteronuclear molecules, unequal AO contributions (from different AO energies/electronegativities) polarize MOs, giving an uneven electron density distribution and hence a dipole moment.  The learning path explicitly ties electronegativity-driven asymmetry to polarity and dipole moments.
Why the other options are wrong: Dipole moment does not require bond order 1; it depends mainly on charge separation and distance.  Electronegativity difference is a key driver of polarity, so dipole moment is not independent of it.  Dipoles occur in \(\sigma\)-bonded molecules as well; \(\pi\) bonding is not a requirement.

7) Applying Hückel’s \(4n+2\) rule and basic \(\pi\)-electron counting, which set lists only aromatic \(\pi\)-electron counts?
A. 2, 6, 10, 14  
B. 4, 8, 12, 16  
C. 3, 7, 11, 15  
D. 6, 8, 12, 18  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Hückel aromatic electron counts follow \(4n+2\) giving 2, 6, 10, 14, … for cyclic conjugated systems under the usual planarity and conjugation assumptions.  The same unit emphasizes \(4n+2\) as the aromaticity criterion for annular \(\pi\)-electron systems.
Why the other options are wrong: 4, 8, 12, 16 are \(4n\) counts and are associated with antiaromaticity under the same idealized conditions.  The sequences 3,7,11,15 and the mixed set 6,8,12,18 do not match a consistent \(4n+2\) aromatic series.

8) The cyclopentadienyl anion \(\mathrm{C_5H_5^-}\) is aromatic mainly because it has:
A. 6 \(\pi\) electrons in a cyclic conjugated system  
B. 4 \(\pi\) electrons in a cyclic conjugated system  
C. 8 \(\pi\) electrons due to the negative charge  
D. No \(\pi\) electrons; aromaticity comes from \(\sigma\) bonding  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In Hückel treatment of cyclic conjugated systems, \(\mathrm{C_5H_5^-}\) is a standard example: the extra electron from the negative charge makes the ring have 6 \(\pi\) electrons, satisfying \(4n+2\) with \(n=1\).  This matches the unit’s focus on applying Hückel ideas to cyclic conjugated (annular) systems including cyclopentadienyl species.
Why the other options are wrong: 4 \(\pi\) electrons would correspond to a \(4n\) count, not Hückel aromatic.  The anion does not have 8 \(\pi\) electrons; proper \(\pi\)-electron counting for the conjugated ring gives 6.  Aromaticity is a \(\pi\)-electron delocalization concept, not a purely \(\sigma\)-bond framework effect.

9) The tropylium cation \(\mathrm{C_7H_7^+}\) is aromatic primarily because it has:
A. 6 \(\pi\) electrons delocalized over a cyclic conjugated ring  
B. 7 \(\pi\) electrons because there are 7 carbon atoms  
C. 8 \(\pi\) electrons because of the positive charge  
D. 4 \(\pi\) electrons and therefore aromatic by \(4n\) rule  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Tropylium cation is another standard annular system in Hückel applications; it has 6 \(\pi\) electrons delocalized over the ring, satisfying the \(4n+2\) rule.  The unit explicitly lists tropylium cation among cyclic conjugated systems treated under Hückel concepts.
Why the other options are wrong: The number of ring atoms is not the \(\pi\)-electron count; \(\pi\)-electron counting depends on conjugation and charge.  A positive charge generally reduces the \(\pi\)-electron count by removing an electron from the \(\pi\) system, it does not automatically make it 8.  The \(4n\) rule does not define aromaticity; \(4n\) counts are associated with antiaromaticity under ideal conditions.

10) In the Hückel MO picture for a linear conjugated system such as butadiene, the best qualitative statement is:
A. There are four \(\pi\) MOs, and filling with four \(\pi\) electrons gives two filled bonding MOs in the ground state  
B. There are two \(\pi\) MOs total because there are two double bonds  
C. The lowest \(\pi\) MO must be antibonding because conjugation destabilizes  
D. Conjugation implies all \(\pi\) MOs are degenerate in energy  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For a linear conjugated chain, the Hückel/LCAO framework uses one p orbital per conjugated atom, producing the same number of \(\pi\) MOs as p orbitals; for butadiene that means four \(\pi\) MOs.  With four \(\pi\) electrons, the ground state fills the two lowest-energy (net bonding) \(\pi\) MOs, capturing conjugation stabilization relative to isolated double bonds.
Why the other options are wrong: The number of \(\pi\) MOs is tied to the number of conjugated p orbitals (atoms), not the count of double bonds.  The lowest MO is typically bonding (stabilized) rather than antibonding; conjugation stabilizes by allowing lower-energy delocalized combinations.  Degeneracy is not universal in linear conjugated systems; energy levels are generally split and ordered.
