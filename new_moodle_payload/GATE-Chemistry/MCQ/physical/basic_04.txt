1) The **improper rotation axis** \(S_n\) corresponds to which operation?

A. Rotation by \(360^\circ/n\) about an axis, followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis  
B. Reflection in a plane containing the axis, followed by rotation by \(360^\circ/n\)  
C. Inversion through a center, followed by reflection in any mirror plane  
D. Rotation by \(180^\circ\) about any axis, followed by inversion  

Correct answer: Rotation by \(360^\circ/n\) about an axis, followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis

Explanation: An improper rotation \(S_n\) is defined as a proper rotation \(C_n\) (rotation by \(360^\circ/n\)) followed immediately by reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.  This is a *single* symmetry operation used frequently in point-group classification (e.g., \(S_4\) in some tetrahedral-like environments).  The option describing reflection in a plane containing the axis corresponds to \(\sigma_v\), not to the definition of \(S_n\).  Inversion is a separate symmetry element \(i\), and combining inversion with other operations does not define \(S_n\).


2) A molecule belongs to the point group \(C_{2v}\). Which set lists only symmetry operations that must be present in \(C_{2v}\)?

A. \(E, C_2, \sigma_v, \sigma_v'\)  
B. \(E, C_3, \sigma_h, i\)  
C. \(E, C_2, i, S_4\)  
D. \(E, C_2, \sigma_h, C_2'\)  

Correct answer: \(E, C_2, \sigma_v, \sigma_v'\)

Explanation: By definition, \(C_{2v}\) contains the identity \(E\), one principal twofold rotation axis \(C_2\), and two vertical mirror planes \(\sigma_v\) that contain the principal axis.  Operations like \(C_3\) are characteristic of \(C_{3v}\) or higher groups, not \(C_{2v}\).  The presence of inversion \(i\) would push the group toward \(C_{2h}\), \(D_{2h}\), etc., not \(C_{2v}\).  A horizontal plane \(\sigma_h\) is not part of \(C_{2v}\); it is typical of \(C_{nh}\) groups.


3) The **order** of a symmetry group of a molecule refers to:

A. The total number of symmetry operations in the group  
B. The number of atoms in the molecule  
C. The highest rotation axis \(n\) present in the molecule  
D. The number of mirror planes present in the molecule  

Correct answer: The total number of symmetry operations in the group

Explanation: In group theory terminology used for molecular symmetry, the order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains.  It is not the atom count (that relates to \(3N\) degrees of freedom for vibrations).  The highest rotation axis \(n\) is a symmetry feature but does not by itself give the group order.  Similarly, counting only mirror planes ignores rotations, identity, inversion, and improper rotations that may be present.


4) In Mulliken symbolism for irreducible representations, what does the label \(E\) indicate?

A. A doubly degenerate irreducible representation  
B. A non-degenerate irreducible representation symmetric to all operations  
C. A triply degenerate irreducible representation  
D. An irreducible representation that is antisymmetric with respect to inversion  

Correct answer: A doubly degenerate irreducible representation

Explanation: Mulliken symbols encode degeneracy and symmetry properties: \(A\) and \(B\) are one-dimensional (non-degenerate), \(E\) is two-dimensional (doubly degenerate), and \(T\) is three-dimensional (triply degenerate).  The statement “symmetric to all operations” describes the totally symmetric representation (often \(A_1\) in many groups), not specifically \(E\).  Antisymmetry with respect to inversion corresponds to “u” (ungerade), not to the letter \(E\).


5) Which statement best distinguishes a **symmetry element** from a **symmetry operation**?

A. A symmetry element is a geometric entity (line/plane/point); a symmetry operation is the action performed using it  
B. A symmetry element is always a rotation; a symmetry operation is always a reflection  
C. A symmetry element exists only in character tables; a symmetry operation exists only in molecules  
D. A symmetry element changes with temperature; a symmetry operation never changes  

Correct answer: A symmetry element is a geometric entity (line/plane/point); a symmetry operation is the action performed using it

Explanation: In molecular symmetry, elements are geometric features such as an axis (\(C_n\)), a plane (\(\sigma\)), or a center (\(i\)), while operations are the actual transformations (rotate, reflect, invert) carried out about/through those elements.  Rotations and reflections are both symmetry operations, not “element vs operation”.  Character tables summarize how functions transform under operations; they do not imply that elements exist only “in tables”.  Temperature may change molecular geometry in extreme cases, but that is not the defining distinction between element and operation.


6) For a nonlinear molecule containing \(N\) atoms, the number of vibrational normal modes is:

A. \(3N-6\)  
B. \(3N-5\)  
C. \(3N\)  
D. \(2N+1\)  

Correct answer: \(3N-6\)

Explanation: A nonlinear molecule has \(3N\) total degrees of freedom; 3 correspond to translation and 3 to rotation, leaving \(3N-6\) vibrational degrees of freedom (normal modes).  The \(3N-5\) rule applies to linear molecules because they have only 2 independent rotational degrees of freedom.  \(3N\) counts all motions without removing translation/rotation, so it is not the vibrational mode count.  \(2N+1\) has no general basis in the internal-coordinate/normal-mode counting described for molecular vibrations.


7) A vibrational mode is **IR active** if it transforms like which type of basis functions in the character table?

A. \(x, y, z\) (components of the dipole moment)  
B. \(R_x, R_y, R_z\) (rotations)  
C. Quadratic functions like \(x^2, xy, yz\) only  
D. Only the totally symmetric representation  

Correct answer: \(x, y, z\) (components of the dipole moment)

Explanation: IR activity requires a change in dipole moment during the vibration, so the vibrational symmetry must match one (or more) of the translational/dipole components \(x, y, z\) listed in the character table.  Rotational functions \(R_x, R_y, R_z\) are used to identify rotational motions and do not give the IR selection rule.  Quadratic functions are tied to Raman activity criteria rather than IR activity.  A totally symmetric vibration can be IR active in some groups if it also transforms as \(x,y,z\), but “only totally symmetric” is not the general rule.


8) A vibrational mode is **Raman active** if it transforms like:

A. Quadratic functions such as \(x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz\)  
B. Only linear functions \(x, y, z\)  
C. Only rotational functions \(R_x, R_y, R_z\)  
D. Only antisymmetric representations (B-type)  

Correct answer: Quadratic functions such as \(x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz\)

Explanation: Raman activity is governed by changes in polarizability, and the polarizability tensor components transform as quadratic functions, which is why character tables list \(x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz\) for Raman selection rules.  The linear functions \(x, y, z\) correspond to dipole moment components and therefore to IR activity, not Raman in general.  Rotational functions help separate rotations when constructing vibrational representations but are not the Raman selection rule.  Raman activity is not restricted to “B-type” representations; it depends on matching quadratic basis functions.


9) In the context of representations in character tables, a **reducible representation** is best described as:

A. A representation that can be expressed as a sum of irreducible representations  
B. A representation that contains only one symmetry operation  
C. A representation that has characters equal to zero for all operations  
D. A representation that exists only for linear molecules  

Correct answer: A representation that can be expressed as a sum of irreducible representations

Explanation: Many practical bases in chemistry (e.g., all \(3N\) Cartesian displacement vectors, or a set of ligand orbitals) generate a reducible representation, which can be decomposed into irreducible components using the reduction procedure.  A representation is defined over all group operations, not a single operation.  Having characters all zero would not represent typical molecular bases and is not the defining feature of reducibility.  Reducible/irreducible representations apply across point groups for both linear and nonlinear molecules.


10) The main purpose of forming **symmetry adapted linear combinations (SALCs)** of ligand atomic orbitals is to:

A. Generate orbital combinations that transform as irreducible representations, enabling symmetry-allowed matching with central-atom orbitals  
B. Ensure all ligand orbitals become non-degenerate  
C. Eliminate the need for any molecular orbital diagram  
D. Convert covalent bonding into ionic bonding by symmetry arguments  

Correct answer: Generate orbital combinations that transform as irreducible representations, enabling symmetry-allowed matching with central-atom orbitals

Explanation: SALCs are constructed so that ligand group orbitals have well-defined symmetry (irreducible representation labels), which allows direct compatibility checks with the symmetry of central atom orbitals in LCAO-MO construction.  SALCs do not guarantee non-degeneracy; degeneracy is dictated by the dimensionality of the irreducible representation (e.g., \(E\) remains doubly degenerate).  SALCs are used to simplify and organize MO construction by symmetry, not to avoid MO theory altogether.  Symmetry does not “convert” bonding type; it classifies and constrains allowed orbital mixing and spectroscopic activity.
