1) A system is maintained at constant temperature and pressure. Consider an infinitesimal change in the extent of reaction \(d\xi\) for a reaction \(\sum_i \nu_i A_i = 0\). Which statement most correctly expresses the equilibrium condition in terms of chemical potentials?

A. \(\sum_i \mu_i = 0\) at equilibrium  
B. \(\sum_i \nu_i \mu_i < 0\) at equilibrium  
C. \(\sum_i \nu_i \mu_i = 0\) at equilibrium  
D. \(\sum_i \nu_i \mu_i > 0\) at equilibrium  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: At constant \(T,P\), the criterion for equilibrium is that the reaction Gibbs energy vanishes: \(\Delta_r G=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right)_{T,P}=\sum_i \nu_i \mu_i=0\).  The inequality forms correspond to spontaneous direction: \(\Delta_r G<0\) implies forward progress (increase in \(\xi\)), while \(\Delta_r G>0\) implies reverse progress; at equilibrium it must be exactly zero.  The unweighted sum \(\sum_i \mu_i\) ignores stoichiometry and therefore cannot represent the equilibrium condition in general.

2) A measurable thermodynamic quantity \(M(T,P)\) is proposed to be a state function. Which test, based on the mathematical framework behind Maxwell relations, is the most appropriate necessary-and-sufficient check?

A. Verify that \(M\) is independent of temperature  
B. Show that \(dM\) can be written as an exact differential (mixed second derivatives are equal under appropriate variables)  
C. Show that \(M\) decreases for every spontaneous process  
D. Confirm that \(M\) is zero at 0 K  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Maxwell relations arise from treating thermodynamic potentials (like \(G, A, H, U\)) as state functions whose differentials are exact; exactness implies equality of mixed second derivatives (a consistency condition).  Independence from temperature is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a state function, because many state functions depend on \(T\).  Monotonic decrease in spontaneous processes is a property of specific potentials under specific constraints (for example, \(G\) at constant \(T,P\)), not a general definition of state function.  A “zero at 0 K” condition is related to the third law for entropy reference, not a general state-function test.

3) For a real gas, fugacity \(f\) is introduced through the chemical potential. Which statement correctly captures why fugacity is essential for equilibrium constants in non-ideal systems?

A. Fugacity replaces temperature in equilibrium expressions, making \(K\) temperature-independent  
B. Fugacity ensures that chemical potentials can be expressed using an “effective pressure,” so equilibrium conditions use activities/fugacities rather than raw pressures  
C. Fugacity is needed only for liquids and solids; gases always use partial pressures directly  
D. Fugacity is numerically equal to pressure at all pressures, so it does not change equilibrium calculations  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Chemical potentials determine equilibrium, and for real systems the “effective concentration” entering \(\mu\) is activity (solutions) or fugacity (gases), not the bare pressure or mole fraction; thus equilibrium expressions must be written in terms of activities/fugacities to remain valid under non-ideality.  Fugacity does not eliminate temperature dependence; \(K\) still depends on \(T\) through \(\Delta G^\circ(T)\) and related relations (van’t Hoff/Gibbs–Helmholtz framework).  Gases can deviate strongly from ideality, so using partial pressure directly can be wrong except in the ideal-gas limit where fugacity approaches pressure.

4) Consider the link between Gibbs–Helmholtz and equilibrium constants. Which statement is most consistent with combining \(\Delta G^\circ=-RT\ln K\) and the temperature dependence of \(\Delta G^\circ\)?

A. If \(\Delta H^\circ>0\), \(K\) must decrease with temperature  
B. If \(\Delta H^\circ>0\), \(K\) tends to increase with temperature  
C. The sign of \(\Delta H^\circ\) gives no information about how \(K\) changes with \(T\)  
D. \(K\) is independent of \(T\) whenever \(\Delta S^\circ\neq 0\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The temperature dependence of \(K\) follows the van’t Hoff form \(\frac{d\ln K}{dT}=\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{RT^2}\), which is consistent with combining equilibrium-constant relations with Gibbs–Helmholtz-type temperature dependence.  Hence, when \(\Delta H^\circ>0\) (endothermic), \(d\ln K/dT>0\) and \(K\) increases with temperature.  The other options invert or deny this enthalpy–temperature linkage, or incorrectly claim temperature independence.

5) In a binary mixture at constant \(T,P\), suppose experimental data suggest \(\gamma_1(x_1)\) varies strongly with composition. What is the most correct implication of the Gibbs–Duhem constraint for modeling \(\gamma_2(x_2)\)?

A. \(\gamma_2\) must be constant, because only one activity coefficient can vary  
B. \(\gamma_2\) must vary in a coupled way; choosing \(\gamma_1(x_1)\) arbitrarily can make \(\gamma_2(x_2)\) thermodynamically inconsistent  
C. \(\gamma_2\) can be chosen independently because Gibbs–Duhem applies only to ideal solutions  
D. \(\gamma_2 = 1/\gamma_1\) for all compositions  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Gibbs–Duhem equation constrains changes in chemical potentials (and therefore activities/activity coefficients) in mixtures, so the composition dependence of one component’s non-ideality cannot be specified independently of the other.  This is why empirical models for non-ideal solutions (such as commonly used parameterized forms) are built to satisfy thermodynamic consistency across both components.  Constancy of \(\gamma_2\), reciprocal relations like \(\gamma_2=1/\gamma_1\), or ignoring the constraint are common modeling misconceptions and generally violate mixture thermodynamics.
