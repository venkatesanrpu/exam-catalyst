1) A reversible association \(A + B \rightleftharpoons AB\) is studied by a temperature-jump relaxation experiment starting from equilibrium. Which statement best justifies why relaxation methods are especially suitable for extracting kinetic information for such a fast, reversible system compared to a simple stopped-flow “mix-and-watch” experiment?

A. Relaxation methods avoid mixing altogether by perturbing an equilibrium system and monitoring return, allowing reversible kinetics to be inferred from relaxation behavior  
B. Relaxation methods always measure diffusion coefficients directly, so rate constants are unnecessary  
C. Stopped-flow cannot be used for any bimolecular reaction, only unimolecular reactions  
D. Relaxation methods work only when the reaction is photochemical  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Relaxation methods deliberately start from equilibrium and apply a small perturbation (temperature/pressure/electric field) and then monitor the return to equilibrium, which is inherently sensitive to forward and reverse rate contributions in reversible fast systems.  Stopped-flow initiates reaction by rapid mixing and is constrained by mixing/dead time and the need to resolve early-time concentration changes; for very fast reversible establishment, early transients can be missed or compressed into dead time.  The idea that relaxation “measures diffusion directly” confuses diffusion-controlled models with relaxation methodology; relaxation primarily provides kinetic relaxation times that relate to underlying rate constants and equilibrium behavior.  Relaxation methods are not restricted to photochemical systems; they are general fast-kinetics tools for reversible processes.

2) Consider a reaction in solution suspected to be diffusion-controlled. Which combined experimental trend most strongly supports diffusion control rather than activation control?

A. Rate increases strongly with temperature but is independent of viscosity  
B. Rate decreases when viscosity increases, and the apparent rate approaches a limiting maximum consistent with diffusion encounter control  
C. Rate is unchanged by solvent viscosity, but quantum yield is greater than unity  
D. Rate decreases with light intensity, and Stern–Volmer plots become nonlinear  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Diffusion-controlled kinetics are characterized by rates limited by transport/encounter in solution, so increasing viscosity (reducing diffusion) lowers the observed bimolecular rate, and rates can approach an upper “diffusion limit” rather than increasing indefinitely.  A strong temperature dependence independent of viscosity is more typical of activation-controlled processes where barrier crossing dominates rather than diffusion encounter.  Quantum yield greater than unity pertains to chain photoreactions and does not diagnose diffusion control in thermal bimolecular encounters.  Changes with light intensity and Stern–Volmer nonlinearity relate to photochemical/photophysical mechanisms (excited-state pathways and quenching behavior), not directly to diagnosing diffusion-limited thermal bimolecular reactions.

3) A fluorophore’s emission intensity decreases with added quencher, but its measured excited-state lifetime remains essentially unchanged. Which interpretation is most consistent with this observation?

A. Purely dynamic (collisional) quenching dominates  
B. A significant static quenching component is present (complex formation/ground-state association), so intensity drops without shortening lifetime  
C. The system must be diffusion-controlled in the Smoluchowski sense  
D. The fluorescence quantum yield must increase with quencher concentration  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The kinetics of photophysical processes and Stern–Volmer analysis distinguish quenching mechanisms; dynamic quenching typically reduces both intensity and lifetime because it introduces an additional excited-state deactivation pathway.  If intensity decreases while lifetime is unchanged, that behavior is consistent with static quenching (e.g., non-emissive ground-state complexes) where fewer fluorophores are emissive but the lifetime of those that do emit is not shortened.  Diffusion-controlled encounter concepts can influence dynamic quenching rates, but unchanged lifetime is not the hallmark of diffusion control; it points to a different quenching mechanism.  Quenchers do not generally increase fluorescence quantum yield; they add nonradiative pathways or remove emissive population, so an “increase” conflicts with the kinetic competition picture for excited-state deactivation.

4) A pulsed excitation (flash photolysis) produces a transient \(T\) that decays back to ground state while also reacting with a substrate \(S\). Which conceptual strategy best matches the integrated fast-kinetics approach for extracting mechanistic information?

A. Use only equilibrium constants; transient time profiles are unnecessary  
B. Monitor time-resolved signals after the pulse, vary \([S]\), and interpret the transient decay as coupled kinetics (intrinsic decay plus reaction), using the transient method suited for short lifetimes  
C. Replace flash photolysis with manual mixing because mixing is always faster than photolysis  
D. Measure only the final product yield and ignore transient observation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Laser flash photolysis is designed for creating and observing transient species on short timescales, and integrated fast-kinetics problem solving emphasizes selecting appropriate transient/spectroscopic methods and interpreting coupled kinetic schemes.  Varying substrate concentration and tracking transient decay allows separation of intrinsic photophysical decay channels from reactive consumption, consistent with formulating kinetic models for primary/secondary processes and using transient techniques to obtain kinetic data.  Relying only on equilibrium constants or only on final yields discards the time-domain information that fast-kinetics methods are built to capture, especially when intermediates are short-lived.  Manual mixing is limited by mixing/dead time and is not generally “faster” than pulsed photochemical generation for nanosecond–microsecond transients.

5) A researcher must choose between (i) stopped-flow rapid mixing and (ii) a relaxation (temperature-jump) method to study a fast reversible reaction where equilibrium is established extremely quickly after perturbation. Which choice and reasoning is most defensible?

A. Choose stopped-flow because reversible reactions cannot be studied by relaxation methods  
B. Choose temperature-jump relaxation because the experiment probes return to equilibrium and can relate the observed relaxation behavior to underlying forward/reverse kinetics for very fast reversible systems  
C. Choose stopped-flow because dead time improves resolution of very fast reactions  
D. Choose neither; only diffusion-controlled theory applies and experiments are unnecessary  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The stated scenario (very fast reversible equilibration) aligns with the defining strength of relaxation methods: perturb an equilibrium system and monitor relaxation back, enabling extraction of kinetic information in regimes where conventional initiation-by-mixing can be constrained by instrument response and dead time.  Stopped-flow is valuable for fast reactions but remains limited by mixing/dead time; dead time does not “improve” resolution—it is a limitation that can prevent observing the earliest kinetics.  Relaxation methods are explicitly introduced as a way to study fast reactions by equilibrium perturbation (temperature-jump/pressure-jump/electric-field-jump), so claiming reversible reactions cannot be studied by relaxation contradicts the method’s purpose.  Diffusion-controlled theory is one mechanistic limit, but it does not replace the need for appropriately chosen experiments when extracting kinetic parameters and mechanisms.
