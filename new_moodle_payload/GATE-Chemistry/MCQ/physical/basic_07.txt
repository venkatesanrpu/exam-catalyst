1) For a non-reacting system at equilibrium, the Gibbs phase rule is:

A. \(F = C - P + 2\)  
B. \(F = P - C + 2\)  
C. \(F = C + P - 2\)  
D. \(F = C - P - 2\)  

Correct answer: \(F = C - P + 2\)

Explanation: Gibbs phase rule relates the number of degrees of freedom \(F\) (independent intensive variables), number of components \(C\), and number of phases \(P\) at equilibrium as \(F = C - P + 2\) for a non-reacting system.
Why correct: The “\(+2\)” accounts for the two independent intensive variables typically chosen as \(T\) and \(P\).
Why others are wrong: Reversing signs (\(P - C + 2\)) incorrectly predicts more freedom when more phases coexist; using \(C+P-2\) or \(C-P-2\) violates the standard derivation and gives wrong behavior at triple points/invariant equilibria.

2) In the phase rule expression, “degrees of freedom” refers to the number of:

A. Extensive variables that can be independently varied  
B. Intensive variables that can be independently varied without changing the number of phases  
C. Moles of each species present in the system  
D. Possible chemical reactions occurring simultaneously  

Correct answer: Intensive variables that can be independently varied without changing the number of phases

Explanation: Degrees of freedom \(F\) is the number of independent intensive variables (such as temperature, pressure, and composition variables) that can be changed while maintaining phase equilibrium.
Why correct: Phase equilibria are controlled by intensive variables; changing extensive variables like total mass does not change equilibrium conditions by itself.
Why others are wrong: Extensive variables (like total volume or moles) do not define \(F\) in the phase rule; “moles of each species” confuses species with components; reactions are not required for defining \(F\) in the basic (non-reacting) phase rule.

3) A triple point in a one-component system corresponds to:

A. One phase in equilibrium  
B. Two phases in equilibrium  
C. Three phases in equilibrium  
D. Two components in equilibrium  

Correct answer: Three phases in equilibrium

Explanation: In a one-component phase diagram, a triple point is the unique condition where three phases of the same substance coexist in equilibrium.
Why correct: “Triple” denotes three phases meeting at a single \(P\)-\(T\) point (e.g., solid–liquid–vapour).
Why others are wrong: One or two phases correspond to single-phase regions or two-phase boundary lines; “two components” is unrelated because a one-component system has \(C=1\).

4) The critical point on a one-component phase diagram is best described as the point where:

A. Solid and liquid become identical  
B. Liquid and vapour become indistinguishable  
C. Three phases coexist  
D. The vapour pressure becomes zero  

Correct answer: Liquid and vapour become indistinguishable

Explanation: The critical point is the end of the liquid–vapour coexistence curve, beyond which a distinct liquid and vapour phase cannot be defined and a supercritical fluid region exists.
Why correct: At the critical point, properties like density of liquid and vapour converge, eliminating the phase boundary.
Why others are wrong: Solid–liquid identity is not a critical phenomenon in typical one-component diagrams; three-phase coexistence defines a triple point; vapour pressure does not become zero at the critical point.

5) The Clausius–Clapeyron equation primarily connects vapour pressure with:

A. Temperature  
B. Volume  
C. Internal energy  
D. Heat capacity  

Correct answer: Temperature

Explanation: The Clausius–Clapeyron equation gives a quantitative relationship between vapour pressure and temperature for phase transitions such as vaporization or sublimation.
Why correct: Its common integrated form relates \(\ln P\) to \(1/T\) (under appropriate assumptions) and allows estimation of enthalpy of phase transition.
Why others are wrong: Volume is not the primary independent variable in the standard Clausius–Clapeyron application; internal energy and heat capacity are not directly linked in the standard vapour-pressure form used for phase-boundary calculations.

6) In a one-component \(P\)–\(T\) phase diagram, a phase boundary line (two-phase equilibrium line) indicates:

A. Only one phase is stable along the line  
B. Two phases coexist in equilibrium along the line  
C. Three phases coexist in equilibrium along the line  
D. The system must be at constant volume  

Correct answer: Two phases coexist in equilibrium along the line

Explanation: A boundary line separates two single-phase regions and represents conditions where the two phases coexist in equilibrium (e.g., liquid–vapour line).
Why correct: Along such a line, the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal, allowing coexistence.
Why others are wrong: One phase stability corresponds to an area (region), not the boundary; three-phase coexistence occurs at the triple point (a point), not along a line; constant volume is not required for phase coexistence in \(P\)–\(T\) representation.

7) The unusual negative slope of the fusion curve of water in the \(P\)–\(T\) diagram implies that:

A. Increasing pressure raises the melting point of ice  
B. Increasing pressure lowers the melting point of ice  
C. Ice is denser than liquid water  
D. Vapour pressure of water is zero at 1 atm  

Correct answer: Increasing pressure lowers the melting point of ice

Explanation: Water shows an “anomalous” fusion curve with negative slope in the \(P\)–\(T\) diagram, meaning increased pressure favors the phase with smaller molar volume (liquid water), lowering the melting temperature.
Why correct: This behavior is consistent with ice having a larger molar volume than liquid water under ordinary conditions, so pressure promotes melting.
Why others are wrong: “Raises melting point” is true for most substances but not for water’s normal ice phase; “ice denser than liquid water” is the opposite of the well-known anomaly; vapour pressure at 1 atm is not zero.

8) An azeotrope in a binary liquid–vapour system is defined as a composition at which:

A. The liquid phase is pure component 1  
B. The vapour phase is pure component 2  
C. Liquid and vapour have the same composition  
D. The mixture freezes at a constant temperature  

Correct answer: Liquid and vapour have the same composition

Explanation: An azeotrope is a special binary composition where the equilibrium vapour composition equals the liquid composition at a given pressure, leading to constant-boiling behavior.
Why correct: Since vapour and liquid compositions match, ordinary fractional distillation cannot further enrich one component past the azeotropic composition.
Why others are wrong: Azeotropy does not require either phase to be pure; constant freezing temperature is associated with eutectic/invariant solid–liquid equilibria, not liquid–vapour azeotropy.

9) The eutectic point in a two-component solid–liquid phase diagram is best described as:

A. A point where liquid and vapour compositions are identical  
B. An invariant point where two solid phases and one liquid phase coexist  
C. A point where two liquids become completely miscible  
D. A point where a supercritical fluid forms  

Correct answer: An invariant point where two solid phases and one liquid phase coexist

Explanation: A eutectic is an invariant equilibrium in a binary solid–liquid system where (typically) two solid phases coexist with a liquid at a fixed temperature and composition.
Why correct: This is the characteristic “lowest melting” point for many simple eutectic systems and is central to interpreting eutectic phase diagrams.
Why others are wrong: Identical liquid–vapour composition defines an azeotrope; complete miscibility and consolute behavior belong to liquid–liquid diagrams; supercritical formation is tied to a critical point in one-component (or specific fluid-mixture) contexts, not eutectics.

10) Fractional distillation separates components mainly because different components (or compositions) have different:

A. Magnetic susceptibility  
B. Volatility (boiling tendency)  
C. Density of the solid phase  
D. Heat of fusion  

Correct answer: Volatility (boiling tendency)

Explanation: Fractional distillation is a separation technique that exploits differences in volatility and the associated vapour–liquid equilibrium behavior across stages (theoretical plates).
Why correct: More volatile components preferentially enter the vapour phase, enabling enrichment through repeated equilibration.
Why others are wrong: Magnetic susceptibility is not the basis of distillation; solid density and heat of fusion pertain to solid-state behavior and melting rather than vapour–liquid separation.
