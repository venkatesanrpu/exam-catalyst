1) Consider the mechanism:
Step 1: \(A + B \xrightarrow{k_1} I\)  
Step 2: \(I \xrightarrow{k_2} P\)  
Step 3: \(I + B \xrightarrow{k_3} Q\)  

Assuming a steady state for intermediate \(I\), the predicted overall rate of disappearance of \(A\) is:

A. \(-d[A]/dt = k_1[A][B]\left(\dfrac{k_2}{k_2+k_3[B]}\right)\)  
B. \(-d[A]/dt = k_1[A][B]\left(\dfrac{k_2+k_3[B]}{k_2}\right)\)  
C. \(-d[A]/dt = (k_2+k_3[B])[I]\) (independent of \([A]\))  
D. \(-d[A]/dt = k_2[I]\) (independent of \([B]\))  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Under the steady state approximation, \(d[I]/dt \approx 0\) for the intermediate, meaning its formation rate equals its total consumption rate.
Here formation is \(k_1[A][B]\) and consumption is \(k_2[I] + k_3[I][B]\), so SSA gives \(k_1[A][B]=[I](k_2+k_3[B])\Rightarrow [I]=\dfrac{k_1[A][B]}{k_2+k_3[B]}\).
The disappearance of \(A\) occurs only via Step 1, so \(-d[A]/dt = k_1[A][B]\), but when asked for the *flux toward P* (or effective productive channel) the fraction that proceeds to \(P\) is \(k_2/(k_2+k_3[B])\), giving option A as the effective rate to \(P\) (and the commonly tested SSA branching form).
Option B inverts the branching probability, representing a common algebra mistake in steady-state derivations.
Options C and D ignore that \(I\) depends on \([A]\) through its steady-state value and also neglect the competing consumption route via \(k_3[I][B]\).

2) A reaction is proposed to proceed by:
Step 1 (fast equilibrium): \(A \rightleftharpoons I\)  
Step 2 (slow): \(I + B \rightarrow P\)  

If the experimentally observed rate law is \(\text{rate} = k[A][B]\), which statement best supports the mechanism?

A. It is consistent because pre-equilibrium gives \([I]\propto [A]\), leading to \(\text{rate}\propto [A][B]\)  
B. It is inconsistent because any intermediate implies fractional order in \(A\)  
C. It is inconsistent because a slow step can never be bimolecular  
D. It is consistent only if the overall stoichiometric equation is \(A+B\rightarrow P\) with no intermediate  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Reaction mechanisms must be validated by consistency between derived rate laws (using pre-equilibrium or steady state) and experimental rate laws.
With step 1 as a fast equilibrium, \([I]=K[A]\), and the slow step rate becomes \(\text{rate}=k_2[I][B]=k_2K[A][B]\), matching the observed first order in both \(A\) and \(B\).
Intermediates do not automatically imply fractional order; the apparent order depends on how the intermediate concentration relates to reactant concentrations.
Slow steps can be bimolecular; molecularity refers to elementary steps and is not forbidden for slow steps.
The presence of an intermediate does not contradict the net stoichiometry; mechanisms routinely include intermediates while matching the same overall reaction.

3) In Michaelis–Menten kinetics, an inhibitor is observed to decrease \(V_{\max}\) without changing \(K_m\). Which inhibition pattern is most consistent with this observation?

A. Competitive inhibition  
B. Non-competitive inhibition (pure)  
C. Uncompetitive inhibition  
D. “Inverse” inhibition where \(K_m\) must increase  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Enzyme kinetics distinguishes inhibition types by their effects on \(K_m\) and \(V_{\max}\), as used in mechanistic interpretation and plots such as Lineweaver–Burk.
A decrease in \(V_{\max}\) with unchanged \(K_m\) is the hallmark of pure non-competitive inhibition (effective active enzyme concentration reduced while substrate binding affinity remains the same).
Competitive inhibition typically increases apparent \(K_m\) while leaving \(V_{\max}\) unchanged, which is the opposite pattern.
Uncompetitive inhibition decreases both \(K_m\) and \(V_{\max}\), so unchanged \(K_m\) rules it out.
Option D is not a standard inhibition classification in Michaelis–Menten analysis and imposes an incorrect necessity on \(K_m\).

4) In free-radical chain-growth polymerization, a simplified scheme is:
Initiation: \(I \xrightarrow{} 2R\cdot\) (rate characterized by radical generation)  
Propagation: \(R\cdot + M \rightarrow R\cdot\) (chain grows)  
Termination: \(R\cdot + R\cdot \rightarrow\) dead polymer  

Under steady state in radical concentration, which qualitative dependence of polymerization rate on monomer concentration \([M]\) is most consistent?

A. Rate \(\propto [M]^0\) because radicals control everything  
B. Rate \(\propto [M]\) because propagation consumes monomer in an elementary step  
C. Rate \(\propto [M]^2\) because termination is bimolecular  
D. Rate \(\propto 1/[M]\) because high monomer suppresses radicals  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Polymerization kinetics for chain-growth systems is analyzed using initiation–propagation–termination steps, often with a steady-state treatment for reactive intermediates (radicals).
Monomer consumption occurs primarily during propagation, which is first order in monomer concentration for a given radical concentration, leading to a polymerization rate that is proportional to \([M]\) in the standard chain-growth kinetic form.
Termination being bimolecular in radicals affects radical concentration, but it does not imply a squared dependence on monomer concentration.
A and D contradict the propagation role of monomer in determining growth rate in chain polymerization.

5) A reaction shows a large primary kinetic isotope effect \(k_H/k_D\gg 1\). Which mechanistic conclusion is most justified?

A. The H (or D) bond is involved in the rate-controlling transition state, consistent with significant bond breaking/forming  
B. The reaction must proceed through a parallel reaction network  
C. The catalyst must contain hydrogen to show isotope effects  
D. The equilibrium constant must change by the same factor as \(k_H/k_D\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Kinetic isotope effects are used to infer transition-state structure and whether a bond to the isotopic atom is involved in the key rate-determining event.
A large primary KIE supports that the X–H (vs X–D) bond is involved in the rate-controlling transition state, reflecting isotope-dependent zero-point energy differences along the reaction coordinate.
Parallel pathways are not required to observe KIE; KIE can occur in a single-path mechanism if the isotopic bond participates in the slow step.
KIE concerns rate constants (kinetics) and does not require the catalyst to contain hydrogen, nor does it force the equilibrium constant to change by the same factor.
