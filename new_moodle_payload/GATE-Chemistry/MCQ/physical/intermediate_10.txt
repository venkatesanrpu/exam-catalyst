1) The decomposition of \(A\) follows first-order kinetics. If \(t_{1/2}=20\ \text{min}\), then the fraction of \(A\) remaining after \(60\ \text{min}\) is:

A. \(1/2\)  
B. \(1/4\)  
C. \(1/8\)  
D. \(1/16\)  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: For a first-order reaction, each half-life reduces concentration by a factor of 2, and the half-life is constant (independent of initial concentration).
Here \(60\ \text{min} = 3\) half-lives, so remaining fraction \(=(1/2)^3=1/8\).
\(1/2\) and \(1/4\) correspond to 1 and 2 half-lives, which would be 20 min and 40 min, not 60 min.
\(1/16\) would correspond to 4 half-lives (80 min), so it overestimates the decay.

2) A reaction has rate law \(\text{rate}=k[A]^2\). If \([A]\) is doubled while temperature is constant, the rate changes by a factor of:

A. 2  
B. 4  
C. 8  
D. 1/4  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Reaction order is taken from the exponents in the experimentally determined rate law, and here the reaction is second order in \(A\).
Doubling \([A]\) gives \(\text{rate}'=k(2[A])^2=4k[A]^2\), so rate increases fourfold.
A factor of 2 would correspond to first order, and a factor of 8 would correspond to third order in \(A\).
A factor of \(1/4\) would occur if \([A]\) were halved, not doubled.

***

3) Consider the mechanism: \(A \xrightarrow{k_1} B \xrightarrow{k_2} C\). If \(k_2 \gg k_1\), the best statement about the concentration of intermediate \(B\) is:

A. \(B\) accumulates to a large concentration because the first step is slow  
B. \(B\) remains small because it is consumed much faster than it is formed  
C. \(B\) must be equal to \(A\) at all times  
D. \(B\) is constant only if the reaction is at equilibrium  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In consecutive reactions, intermediate concentration depends on relative rates of formation and consumption.
If \(k_2 \gg k_1\), \(B\) is rapidly converted to \(C\) and thus does not build up significantly; this aligns with the idea behind treating certain intermediates as short-lived.
Slow formation (small \(k_1\)) does not guarantee accumulation; accumulation requires formation faster than consumption.
The condition is kinetic, not an equilibrium requirement, so equilibrium is not needed for \(B\) to be small.

***

4) In a parallel reaction network \(A \xrightarrow{k_1} P\) and \(A \xrightarrow{k_2} Q\), both first order in \(A\). Starting from only \(A\), the ratio of formation rates of products at any time is:

A. \(\dfrac{d[P]/dt}{d[Q]/dt}=\dfrac{k_1}{k_2}\)  
B. \(\dfrac{d[P]/dt}{d[Q]/dt}=\dfrac{k_2}{k_1}\)  
C. \(\dfrac{d[P]/dt}{d[Q]/dt}=\dfrac{[P]}{[Q]}\)  
D. \(\dfrac{d[P]/dt}{d[Q]/dt}=\dfrac{k_1[A]^2}{k_2}\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For competing (parallel) reactions, selectivity/branching depends on relative pathway rate constants when the order in \(A\) is the same.
Here \(d[P]/dt=k_1[A]\) and \(d[Q]/dt=k_2[A]\), so the ratio is \((k_1[A])/(k_2[A])=k_1/k_2\), independent of time.
The inverse ratio would swap products.
The ratio \([P]/[Q]\) is a consequence of integrated behavior and need not equal the instantaneous rate ratio unless specific conditions apply; the asked quantity is the rate ratio.

***

5) For a reversible first-order system \(A \rightleftharpoons B\) with forward rate constant \(k_f\) and reverse rate constant \(k_r\), which statement is correct?

A. At equilibrium, \([A]/[B]=k_f/k_r\)  
B. At equilibrium, \([B]/[A]=k_f/k_r\)  
C. At equilibrium, \(k_f=k_r\) must hold  
D. Equilibrium cannot be reached if the reaction is first order  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For opposing (reversible) reactions, the forward and reverse rate constants govern approach to equilibrium and are related to the equilibrium composition.
At equilibrium, forward rate equals reverse rate: \(k_f[A]_{eq}=k_r[B]_{eq}\), giving \([B]_{eq}/[A]_{eq}=k_f/k_r\).
Equilibrium does not require \(k_f=k_r\); it requires equality of *rates*, not equality of rate constants.
First-order reversible systems do reach equilibrium; first order does not prevent equilibration.

***

6) A proposed mechanism is:
Step 1 (fast): \(A + B \rightleftharpoons I\)  
Step 2 (slow): \(I + B \rightarrow P\)  
If step 1 is treated as a pre-equilibrium, the predicted overall rate law is:

A. \(\text{rate}=k[A]\)  
B. \(\text{rate}=k[A][B]\)  
C. \(\text{rate}=k[A][B]^2\)  
D. \(\text{rate}=k[B]^2\)  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Mechanism-based rate laws must be consistent with the elementary steps and how intermediates relate to reactants using approximations like pre-equilibrium/steady state.
With pre-equilibrium in step 1, \([I]=K[A][B]\) where \(K=k_1/k_{-1}\) is the equilibrium constant for step 1, and the slow step rate is \(\text{rate}=k_2[I][B]=k_2K[A][B]^2\).
A and B correspond to missing dependence on \(B\) from the slow-step consumption of \(B\).
D ignores the requirement that \(I\) is generated from \(A\) and \(B\).

***

7) In Michaelis–Menten kinetics, \(v=\dfrac{V_{\max}[S]}{K_m+[S]}\). If \([S]=K_m\), then the initial rate \(v\) equals:

A. \(V_{\max}\)  
B. \(V_{\max}/2\)  
C. \(2V_{\max}\)  
D. \(K_m/2\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Michaelis–Menten model relates rate to substrate concentration through \(K_m\) and \(V_{\max}\).
Substituting \([S]=K_m\) gives \(v=V_{\max}K_m/(K_m+K_m)=V_{\max}/2\).
\(V_{\max}\) occurs only in the saturation limit \([S]\gg K_m\).
\(2V_{\max}\) is impossible because \(V_{\max}\) is the maximum achievable rate in this model.

***

8) An enzyme shows \(V_{\max}\) unchanged but apparent \(K_m\) increases upon adding an inhibitor. The inhibition is most consistent with:

A. Competitive inhibition  
B. Non-competitive inhibition  
C. Uncompetitive inhibition  
D. Irreversible inhibition that always lowers \(K_m\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Enzyme inhibition types are distinguished by how they affect \(K_m\) and \(V_{\max}\) in Michaelis–Menten analysis.
Competitive inhibition reduces effective substrate binding (increases apparent \(K_m\)) while leaving \(V_{\max}\) unchanged at sufficiently high \([S]\).
Non-competitive inhibition typically decreases \(V_{\max}\) (since active enzyme fraction is reduced), which contradicts the observation.
Uncompetitive inhibition decreases both \(K_m\) and \(V_{\max}\), so it also contradicts the observation.

***

9) In Arrhenius behavior, if the activation energy \(E_a\) is unchanged but temperature increases, the rate constant \(k\) will:

A. Decrease because collisions become less effective  
B. Increase because \(k\) depends exponentially on temperature in the Arrhenius equation  
C. Remain constant because \(E_a\) is constant  
D. Become independent of temperature for elementary reactions  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Arrhenius equation links the temperature dependence of reaction rates to activation energy and temperature.
With higher temperature, a larger fraction of molecules can overcome the activation barrier, so \(k\) increases according to Arrhenius temperature dependence.
A contradicts collision/Arrhenius concepts used to interpret temperature effects on rates.
A constant \(E_a\) does not imply constant \(k\); \(T\) still changes \(k\).

***

10) A primary kinetic isotope effect is measured as \(k_H/k_D \approx 6\) for a reaction where H is replaced by D. The most reasonable inference is:

A. The isotopic atom is not involved in the rate-controlling step  
B. Bond to H is significantly involved in the transition state of the rate-controlling step  
C. The reaction is necessarily diffusion-controlled  
D. The equilibrium constant must have changed by a factor of 6  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Kinetic isotope effects are used to infer transition-state involvement and bond-breaking/forming patterns.
A large \(k_H/k_D\) (typical of a substantial primary isotope effect) indicates that the bond to H (vs D) is involved in the rate-determining transition state, consistent with zero-point energy differences affecting the barrier.
Diffusion control is a separate kinetic regime and is not implied solely by observing a large KIE.
KIE refers to rate constants (kinetics), not necessarily a proportional change in equilibrium constant (thermodynamics).
