1) Fast reaction kinetics is primarily concerned with reactions that occur on which approximate timescale range?

A. Hours to days  
B. Minutes to hours  
C. Microseconds to nanoseconds  
D. Years to decades  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Fast reaction kinetics deals with reactions so rapid that conventional “mix, wait, and sample” methods cannot follow them in real time; typical lifetimes are in the microsecond to nanosecond regime.  Hours-to-days and minutes-to-hours are accessible by standard kinetic monitoring (e.g., spectrophotometry with ordinary mixing).  Years-to-decades is unrelated to laboratory fast-kinetics methodology.

2) In relaxation methods, the experiment begins by:

A. Rapidly mixing two reactant solutions and monitoring product formation  
B. Perturbing a system at equilibrium and monitoring its return to equilibrium  
C. Removing catalyst and monitoring rate decrease  
D. Measuring viscosity to infer diffusion coefficient directly  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Relaxation methods are based on disturbing an equilibrium system (by temperature-jump, pressure-jump, or electric-field-jump) and observing the relaxation back to equilibrium.  Rapid mixing followed by monitoring corresponds to flow/rapid-mixing methods, not relaxation methods.  Removing catalyst is not the defining operational principle of relaxation kinetics.  Viscosity/diffusion may influence rates in diffusion control, but it is not the defining start-step of relaxation experiments.

3) A stopped-flow technique is best described as:

A. A perturbation method that uses pressure pulses to shift equilibrium  
B. A rapid-mixing method that observes kinetics immediately after mixing  
C. A method that only works for gas-phase unimolecular reactions  
D. A method used only for measuring phosphorescence lifetimes  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Stopped-flow is a rapid-mixing (flow) technique designed to follow fast kinetics right after reactants are mixed, accounting for mixing/dead time.  Pressure-jump is a relaxation (perturbation) method, not a flow method.  Stopped-flow is widely used for solution kinetics (including enzyme kinetics), not restricted to gas-phase unimolecular reactions.  Phosphorescence lifetimes belong to photophysical kinetics; stopped-flow is not “only” for that purpose.

4) The term “dead time” in rapid-mixing/flow experiments most directly refers to:

A. The time after completion of reaction when signal stops changing  
B. The time between mixing and the earliest reliable measurement  
C. The lifetime of the excited singlet state  
D. The time required for diffusion-controlled encounter  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Dead time is the instrumental/mixing limitation: the interval between initiating the reaction by mixing and when the detector can first observe a trustworthy signal.  It is not the late-time plateau after reaction completion (that is simply reaching completion or steady signal).  Excited-state lifetimes are photophysical parameters, not the definition of mixing dead time.  Diffusion encounter time can influence kinetics, but “dead time” is an apparatus/measurement constraint.

5) A diffusion-controlled reaction is one in which the observed rate is limited mainly by:

A. The intrinsic activation barrier of the chemical step  
B. Diffusion of reactants through the solvent to meet  
C. The intensity of incident light only  
D. The equilibrium constant of the ground-state reactants only  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In diffusion-controlled reactions, the rate is governed by how quickly reactants can diffuse and encounter each other in solution rather than by the intrinsic chemical transformation once they meet.  If an intrinsic activation barrier dominates, the process is activation-controlled, not diffusion-controlled.  Light intensity is relevant for photochemical initiation, not as the defining limitation of diffusion-controlled thermal encounters.  An equilibrium constant alone does not set the encounter-limited rate; transport (diffusion) is the key limitation.

6) A Jablonski diagram is primarily used to represent:

A. Diffusion flux lines of reactants in a solvent  
B. Electronic states and radiative/nonradiative transitions between them  
C. Mixing patterns in stopped-flow chambers  
D. Pressure dependence of equilibrium constants in relaxation methods  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A Jablonski diagram is an energy-level scheme showing electronic states (e.g., singlet/triplet) and pathways like fluorescence, phosphorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing.  It is not a diagram of diffusion flux or solvent transport.  It is unrelated to mechanical mixing geometries of flow devices.  Pressure dependence of equilibria is addressed in pressure-jump concepts, not by Jablonski diagrams.

7) Which process is photophysical rather than photochemical?

A. Formation of new chemical products after excitation  
B. Fluorescence emission from an excited state  
C. Photoinduced bond cleavage producing radicals  
D. Light-initiated chain reaction with net chemical change  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Photophysical processes involve deactivation of excited states without chemical change, such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing.  Formation of new products, bond cleavage, and chain reactions represent photochemical outcomes because they involve chemical transformation.  The key distinction is whether excitation leads to chemistry (photochemical) or only state-to-state relaxation/emission (photophysical).

8) Quantum yield in photochemistry is best defined as:

A. Photons emitted per molecule initially present  
B. Number of specified events (reaction or emission) per photon absorbed  
C. Rate constant of intersystem crossing  
D. Fraction of light transmitted through a sample  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Quantum yield is the ratio of the number of events of a particular type (such as product formation or photon emission) to the number of photons absorbed.  Photons emitted per molecule initially present is not tied to absorbed photons and can misrepresent efficiency.  A single rate constant (e.g., intersystem crossing) contributes to quantum yield but is not the definition.  Transmittance concerns optical attenuation, not event-per-absorbed-photon efficiency.

9) Stern–Volmer analysis is most directly associated with studying:

A. Pressure-jump relaxation back to equilibrium  
B. Fluorescence quenching behavior  
C. Diffusion-controlled bimolecular rate limits only in the dark  
D. Mixing dead time in stopped-flow instruments  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Stern–Volmer analysis is used to analyze fluorescence quenching (including dynamic and static quenching) and relate changes in intensity/lifetime to quencher presence.  Pressure-jump is a relaxation technique but not the Stern–Volmer framework.  Although diffusion can affect dynamic quenching, Stern–Volmer analysis is not restricted to “diffusion-controlled in the dark”; it is specifically a quenching relationship used in excited-state kinetics.  Mixing dead time is an instrumental concept in flow methods, not a fluorescence quenching model.

10) Laser flash photolysis is mainly used to:

A. Generate and monitor transient species on very short timescales  
B. Measure equilibrium constants by slow titration  
C. Determine viscosity by capillary flow  
D. Increase mixing efficiency in stopped-flow experiments  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Laser flash photolysis uses a short light pulse to create reactive/transient species and then monitors their evolution on very short timescales, enabling observation of short-lived intermediates.  Slow titration is not a transient, fast-kinetics technique.  Viscosity measurement by capillary flow is a transport-property experiment, not flash photolysis.  Stopped-flow mixing efficiency is a mechanical/flow design issue, not something laser flash photolysis is designed to improve.
