1) A real adsorbent surface shows two distinct site types: a small fraction of very strong-binding sites and a large fraction of weak-binding sites. Over a moderate pressure range, the adsorption data fits a Freundlich form better than a Langmuir form. The most defensible interpretation is:

A. Langmuir must always fit better because it is derived from kinetic equilibrium  
B. Freundlich can capture effective heterogeneity (distribution of binding energies), while Langmuir assumes uniform identical sites  
C. BET is invalid for any heterogeneous surface, so Freundlich is the only possible model  
D. The better Freundlich fit proves multilayer adsorption is occurring  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The unit emphasizes that Freundlich is an empirical power-law model commonly applied to heterogeneous surfaces and reflects site heterogeneity/binding-energy distributions, whereas Langmuir assumes a uniform surface with identical sites and no lateral interactions.  A “derived” model can still fail if its assumptions (uniform sites, monolayer saturation behavior) are violated by the real surface.  BET addresses multilayer adsorption and surface area determination; heterogeneity alone does not automatically invalidate BET, and a Freundlich fit does not prove multilayer formation.

2) In a Langmuir–Hinshelwood catalytic mechanism, consider two limiting cases: (i) adsorption is fast and the surface reaction between adsorbed species is slow, (ii) adsorption is slow but the surface reaction is fast once adsorbed. Which experimental signature most directly helps distinguish these cases?

A. Whether products can desorb from the surface at all  
B. Whether the observed rate shows strong dependence on surface coverage/adsorption equilibrium (e.g., saturation-like behavior) versus tracking the adsorption step  
C. Whether the reactants are gases rather than liquids  
D. Whether BET surface area can be measured for the catalyst  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Langmuir–Hinshelwood framework links overall rate to adsorption, surface reaction, and desorption steps, and the unit highlights using kinetic data to identify the rate-limiting step.  If adsorption equilibrates rapidly, the rate law often reflects coverage-controlled (saturation-type) behavior; if adsorption is rate-limiting, the rate tracks adsorption kinetics more directly rather than a saturated coverage dependence.  Product desorption being possible is necessary but not the most diagnostic for distinguishing adsorption-limited vs surface-reaction-limited regimes, and phase (gas/liquid) or BET measurability does not directly identify the rate-limiting step.

3) A student claims: “Because BET extends Langmuir, any good Langmuir fit automatically implies BET will yield an accurate surface area.” The best critique is:

A. BET is only for chemisorption, so it cannot be used when Langmuir fits  
B. BET requires multilayer adsorption assumptions and appropriate pressure range; a Langmuir fit may occur where multilayer effects are negligible, so BET area may be poorly constrained  
C. Langmuir and BET are mathematically identical, so the claim is correct  
D. BET does not involve monolayer capacity, so surface area cannot be obtained anyway  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The unit states that BET is a multilayer adsorption model used to obtain monolayer capacity and thus surface area, relying on multilayer assumptions and proper application conditions.  A Langmuir fit can describe monolayer-dominated adsorption on uniform sites, but that does not guarantee the BET multilayer regime is adequately sampled or that BET assumptions apply over the measured range.  BET is commonly applied to physisorption for surface area estimation and explicitly uses monolayer capacity; therefore the other statements are incorrect.

4) Self-assembly of amphiphiles into micelles in water is often explained as being driven by “hydrophobic interactions.” Which statement best aligns with the unit’s thermodynamic framing?

A. Micellization occurs because forming micelles always decreases entropy  
B. Micellization is driven by overall free-energy minimization, with enthalpic and entropic contributions, and relates to interfacial tension reduction and amphiphile structure  
C. Micellization is purely a kinetic phenomenon and does not depend on thermodynamics  
D. Micelles form only because surfactants chemisorb on each other  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The unit frames self-assembly as spontaneous organization driven by intermolecular forces and thermodynamics and explicitly links amphiphiles, interfacial tension, and free-energy minimization to self-assembled structures like micelles.  The driving force is not “entropy must decrease”; rather, the balance of enthalpy/entropy determines whether \(\Delta G\) becomes favorable for aggregation.  Treating micellization as purely kinetic or as chemisorption is inconsistent with the surfactant/amphiphile and self-assembly concepts emphasized.

5) In colloidal stability (DLVO picture), a dispersion becomes unstable when salt concentration is increased significantly. The best explanation is:

A. Added salt increases van der Waals attraction directly by creating new covalent bonds  
B. Added salt compresses the electrostatic double layer, reducing repulsion and allowing attractive forces to dominate, promoting coagulation/flocculation  
C. Added salt always increases zeta potential magnitude, stabilizing the colloid  
D. Added salt forces micelle formation, which removes all particles from solution  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The unit highlights DLVO theory as a balance of attractive and repulsive interactions and includes zeta potential and stabilization/destabilization mechanisms such as coagulation/flocculation.  Increasing ionic strength typically compresses the electrical double layer, reducing electrostatic repulsion so that van der Waals attraction can dominate, leading to aggregation.  The other options misattribute the mechanism (covalent bonding), reverse the typical effect on electrostatic stabilization, or confuse colloidal particle aggregation with micellization.
