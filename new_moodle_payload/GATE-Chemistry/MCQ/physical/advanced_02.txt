1) In a two-electron atom, a proposed total wavefunction is written as a product \(\Psi(1,2)=\psi(1)\psi(2)\chi(1,2)\) where \(\psi(1)\psi(2)\) is symmetric under exchange \(1 \leftrightarrow 2\) and \(\chi(1,2)\) is also symmetric. Which statement is most accurate?
A. This is acceptable because orbital approximation allows symmetric total wavefunctions  
B. This violates the antisymmetry requirement for electrons unless the wavefunction is antisymmetrized (e.g., via a Slater determinant)  
C. This becomes acceptable only in atomic units  
D. This is acceptable only if the electrons have different principal quantum numbers  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Electrons are fermions, so the total electronic wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of two electrons (antisymmetry requirement).  A symmetric spatial part multiplied by a symmetric spin part gives an overall symmetric product, which violates this requirement.  Slater determinants provide a standard way to enforce antisymmetry using spin-orbitals, and atomic units are just a unit system and do not alter exchange symmetry.


2) A linear-variational calculation uses a trial function \(\psi=\sum_i c_i\phi_i\), and the secular determinant yields multiple eigenvalues. Which statement correctly interprets these variational roots?
A. All roots are guaranteed to be lower bounds to the exact ground-state energy  
B. The lowest root is the best variational estimate of the ground-state energy within the chosen basis, and it is an upper bound to the exact ground-state energy  
C. The highest root is always the most accurate because it uses more basis mixing  
D. Variational roots are exact if the basis functions are hydrogen-like orbitals  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Rayleigh–Ritz (variational) principle implies that, for the ground state, the minimum energy obtained by optimizing the trial function gives an upper bound to the true ground-state energy.  In a multi-parameter (basis expansion) treatment, the secular equation produces several stationary energies; the lowest root corresponds to the best ground-state estimate achievable in that chosen subspace.  Hydrogen-like orbitals can be a useful starting point in the orbital approximation, but they do not make multi-electron energies exact because electron–electron repulsion remains.


3) In degenerate first-order perturbation theory, why is it necessary to diagonalize \(H'\) within the degenerate subspace rather than directly using \(E^{(1)}=\langle \psi^{(0)}|H'|\psi^{(0)}\rangle\) on the original degenerate eigenfunctions?   
A. Because the perturbation changes the value of \(\hbar\) in atomic units  
B. Because within a degenerate subspace, the unperturbed eigenfunctions are not uniquely defined, and \(H'\) can mix them, so correct first-order states/energies come from diagonalization in that subspace  
C. Because Slater determinants cannot be formed for degenerate states  
D. Because the orbital approximation forbids degeneracy  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: When levels are degenerate, any linear combination of degenerate eigenfunctions is also an acceptable unperturbed eigenfunction, so the “original” \(\psi^{(0)}\) choices are not unique.  A perturbation can couple (mix) these states, and the correct first-order energies and zeroth-order combinations are obtained by diagonalizing the perturbation matrix restricted to the degenerate manifold.  This requirement is independent of atomic units, and degeneracy is a common feature of central-field/orbital pictures rather than something forbidden by them.


4) Which option best explains, at a conceptual level, how the Slater determinant simultaneously enforces Pauli exclusion and the antisymmetry requirement?
A. It forces all electrons to occupy different principal quantum numbers, and therefore they cannot be exchanged  
B. It becomes zero if any two electrons occupy the same spin-orbital, and it changes sign upon exchange of two electrons’ coordinates  
C. It makes the wavefunction symmetric in space and antisymmetric in spin for all configurations  
D. It works only when effective nuclear charge is constant for all electrons  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The determinant changes sign when two electron labels are exchanged, automatically giving antisymmetry under exchange.  If two electrons are assigned the same spin-orbital, two columns (or rows) become identical and the determinant becomes zero, encoding Pauli exclusion directly.  The determinant does not force a particular “always symmetric space/antisymmetric spin” pattern; the symmetry of space and spin parts depends on the specific state construction.


5) In the orbital approximation for multi-electron atoms, introducing an effective nuclear charge is often viewed as a crude way to incorporate screening. If a variational parameter is chosen to mimic this effective nuclear charge in a helium-like atom, what is the key reason the variational estimate improves compared to using the bare \(Z\) of the nucleus in a hydrogenic orbital?
A. The variational method removes the need for electron–electron repulsion terms in the Hamiltonian  
B. A tunable parameter lets the trial wavefunction adjust to electron–electron screening, lowering the expectation value of energy and moving closer to the true ground state  
C. Screening is a purely spin effect, so optimizing \(Z_{\text{eff}}\) optimizes spin directly  
D. The secular determinant becomes unnecessary when an effective nuclear charge is used  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Multi-electron atoms are not exactly hydrogenic because electron–electron repulsion alters the effective attraction experienced by each electron, often described qualitatively as screening/shielding and effective nuclear charge.  A variational parameter that adjusts the orbital “tightness” can partially account for this physics, thereby lowering the energy expectation value relative to a poor fixed choice and improving the approximation within the chosen trial family.  Electron–electron repulsion is not removed; it is indirectly accommodated by a better-shaped trial function, and secular-determinant machinery is still relevant whenever multiple parameters/basis functions are used.
