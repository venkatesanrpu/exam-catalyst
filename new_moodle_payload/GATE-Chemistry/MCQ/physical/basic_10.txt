1) For an **elementary** reaction step, the rate law is most directly determined by:

A. Overall stoichiometric equation of the net reaction  
B. Stoichiometry (molecularity) of that single step  
C. Thermodynamic equilibrium constant only  
D. The catalyst concentration only  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In an elementary (single-step) reaction, the rate law follows directly from the molecularity/stoichiometry of that step (e.g., bimolecular step \(\text{rate} \propto [A][B]\)).
The overall (net) stoichiometric equation may combine multiple steps, so it does not necessarily give the correct rate law for complex mechanisms.
The equilibrium constant is a thermodynamic quantity and does not by itself determine the kinetic rate law.
Catalyst concentration can affect rate in catalyzed mechanisms, but it is not the defining rule for elementary-step rate laws.

2) The term **reaction order** is best defined as:

A. The sum of stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation  
B. The sum of exponents of concentration terms in the experimentally determined rate law  
C. The number of products formed per unit time  
D. The number of elementary steps in the mechanism  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Reaction order is defined from the experimentally determined rate law; it equals the sum of powers of reactant concentrations appearing in the rate expression.
Stoichiometric coefficients match rate-law exponents only for elementary steps, not in general.
“Number of products formed per unit time” describes a rate but not the *order*.
The number of elementary steps is a mechanistic feature and is not the definition of overall order.

***

3) The **steady state approximation** in mechanism analysis assumes that:

A. The concentration of reactants stays constant throughout the reaction  
B. The concentration of intermediates remains approximately constant after an initial transient  
C. The reaction is at equilibrium at all times  
D. The rate constant is independent of temperature  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The steady state (stationary state) approximation sets \(d[\text{intermediate}]/dt \approx 0\), meaning intermediates are formed and consumed at nearly equal rates after a short initial period.
Reactant concentrations generally change with time, so they are not assumed constant by SSA.
SSA is not the same as equilibrium; equilibrium would imply no net progress of reaction.
Temperature dependence is captured by Arrhenius behavior; SSA does not assume temperature independence.

***

4) In **parallel (competing)** reactions, a key kinetic quantity that determines product selectivity is:

A. The boiling points of the products  
B. The branching ratio based on competing rate constants  
C. The equilibrium constant of an unrelated reaction  
D. The total number of atoms in each product  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In parallel reactions, product distribution depends on the relative rates of competing pathways, often expressed through branching ratios involving the competing rate constants (and relevant reactant concentrations).
Boiling points and atom counts do not determine kinetic selectivity.
An equilibrium constant for an unrelated process does not control the kinetic branching between two competing pathways.

***

5) In an **opposing (reversible)** reaction \(A \rightleftharpoons B\), the “forward” and “reverse” rate constants primarily control:

A. The color of the reaction mixture  
B. How quickly equilibrium is approached  
C. The molar mass of A  
D. Whether the reaction must be catalyzed  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For reversible kinetics, the forward and reverse rate constants govern the time-evolution of concentrations and therefore the rate of approach to equilibrium.
Color and molar mass are not determined by kinetic constants.
Catalysis may change rates, but reversibility does not imply the reaction must be catalyzed.

***

6) In a **consecutive** mechanism \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C\), species \(B\) is best described as:

A. A catalyst  
B. An intermediate  
C. A solvent  
D. A promoter that is not consumed  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In consecutive reactions \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C\), \(B\) is formed in one step and consumed in the next, which is the defining feature of an intermediate.
A catalyst is regenerated and not consumed overall; an intermediate is consumed as the mechanism proceeds.
Solvent is not a transient species produced and then consumed in the mechanism.
A “promoter” is not the standard kinetic term for a species like \(B\) in consecutive schemes.

***

7) A **catalyst** is best characterized by which statement?

A. It increases the equilibrium constant \(K\) of the reaction  
B. It lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative pathway and is not consumed overall  
C. It is always present in larger amount than reactants  
D. It changes \(\Delta G^\circ\) to make the reaction spontaneous  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Catalysis speeds reactions by lowering the effective activation barrier via an alternative pathway while being regenerated (not consumed overall).
Catalysts do not change the thermodynamic driving force (\(\Delta G^\circ\)) or the equilibrium constant; they affect kinetics, not equilibrium position.
A catalyst need not be present in larger amount than reactants; even small amounts can show turnover.

***

8) In the Michaelis–Menten mechanism for enzyme catalysis, the complex \(ES\) represents:

A. An enzyme permanently converted into product  
B. The enzyme–substrate complex formed during substrate binding  
C. A catalyst poison that irreversibly deactivates enzyme  
D. The final product bound to solvent molecules  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Enzyme kinetics commonly models formation of an enzyme–substrate complex \(ES\) as an intermediate step leading to product formation.
The enzyme is not permanently converted into product; it is regenerated after product release.
Catalyst poisons/inhibitors are different entities and are not what \(ES\) denotes.
\(ES\) is not the final product-solvent assembly; it is the bound state of enzyme and substrate.

***

9) In **polymerization kinetics**, “chain-growth polymerization” is most closely associated with:

A. Stepwise condensation between any two oligomers at all stages  
B. Initiation, propagation, and termination steps of an active chain  
C. Only equilibrium between monomer and polymer  
D. A mechanism that cannot involve radicals  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Chain-growth polymerization proceeds via distinct initiation, propagation, and termination steps involving an active center (often radicals or ions).
Step-growth polymerization is characterized by stepwise reactions between molecules of many sizes, not the active-chain propagation framework.
Polymerization kinetics is not “only equilibrium”; growth rates depend on kinetic steps.
Radicals are common in chain-growth (free-radical polymerization), so it is incorrect to say it cannot involve radicals.

***

10) A **primary kinetic isotope effect** is most indicative of:

A. Isotope substitution at a position not involved in bond breaking/forming in the rate-determining step  
B. A change in rate due to isotope substitution where the bond to the isotope is involved in the key bond-breaking/forming event  
C. No change in reaction rate upon isotope substitution  
D. The catalyst being an isotope of the reactant  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A primary kinetic isotope effect arises when the isotopically substituted atom participates directly in the bond-breaking/forming event associated with the rate-controlling transition state, making the rate sensitive to isotope-dependent zero-point energy differences.
Substitution at a non-involved position corresponds more to secondary isotope effects, not primary.
KIE by definition involves a rate change; “no change” contradicts the concept.
The catalyst being an isotope of reactant is not the meaning of kinetic isotope effect.
