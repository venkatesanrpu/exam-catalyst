1) A binary liquid–vapour system at fixed pressure shows an azeotropic point in the \(T\)-\(x\) diagram. Considering Gibbs phase rule and the defining condition of an azeotrope, which statement best describes the degrees of freedom at the azeotropic point (at fixed \(P\))?

A. One intensive variable can be changed independently while retaining two phases and azeotropic condition.  
B. No intensive variable can be changed independently while retaining two phases and azeotropic condition.  
C. Two intensive variables can be changed independently while retaining two phases and azeotropic condition.  
D. Degrees of freedom is the same everywhere in the two-phase region, so the azeotropic point is not special.  

Correct answer: No intensive variable can be changed independently while retaining two phases and azeotropic condition.

Explanation: In a binary two-phase (L+V) region at fixed pressure, the reduced phase rule gives \(F' = C - P + 1 = 2-2+1=1\), so normally one variable (e.g., \(T\)) can be varied and the equilibrium compositions adjust.
At an azeotrope there is an additional constraint: liquid and vapour compositions are identical (a singular point in the \(T\)-\(x\) diagram), which removes that remaining freedom, making the azeotropic state effectively invariant at that pressure.
Why others are wrong: Claiming one or two degrees of freedom ignores the extra azeotropic constraint; stating it is “not special” contradicts the text’s emphasis that the azeotrope appears as a singular point and imposes a distillation limitation.

2) In a one-component \(P\)–\(T\) diagram, the liquid–vapour equilibrium curve terminates at a critical point. Using phase-rule reasoning, which statement is the most accurate about how degrees of freedom changes when moving from (i) a two-phase point on the liquid–vapour curve to (ii) the critical point?

A. \(F\) changes from 0 to 1 because two phases become one phase at the critical point.  
B. \(F\) remains 1 at both locations because both still lie on a phase boundary.  
C. \(F\) changes from 1 on the coexistence curve to 2 at the critical point because it becomes a single-phase region endpoint.  
D. \(F\) changes from 2 to 1 because a critical point is an invariant point like a triple point.  

Correct answer: \(F\) changes from 1 on the coexistence curve to 2 at the critical point because it becomes a single-phase region endpoint.

Explanation: For a one-component system, Gibbs phase rule is \(F=C-P+2\).
On a liquid–vapour coexistence curve, \(C=1\), \(P=2\) so \(F=1\); at the critical point the distinction between liquid and vapour disappears, effectively yielding a single phase (\(P=1\)) and thus \(F=2\), consistent with being able to vary \(T\) and \(P\) within a one-phase region.
Why others are wrong: Treating the critical point like a triple point (invariant) is incorrect; also, the critical point is not a generic two-phase boundary point because the two phases become indistinguishable there.

3) A binary liquid–liquid system shows a UCST with a consolute point. At a temperature slightly below UCST, a mixture splits into two liquid phases with compositions given by the ends of a tie line. Which statement correctly links the lever rule to the binodal/tie-line picture?

A. The lever rule applies only to solid–liquid eutectic diagrams, not to liquid–liquid diagrams.  
B. The overall composition must lie outside the binodal for the lever rule to be used.  
C. The overall composition lies on the tie line connecting the two coexisting compositions, and phase amounts are inversely proportional to the segment lengths.  
D. Tie lines exist only at the consolute point, so lever rule can be applied only at UCST.  

Correct answer: The overall composition lies on the tie line connecting the two coexisting compositions, and phase amounts are inversely proportional to the segment lengths.

Explanation: In partially miscible liquid–liquid systems, the two-phase region is bounded by the binodal curve, and tie lines connect compositions of the two coexisting liquid phases at a given temperature.
The lever rule is explicitly used in liquid–liquid phase diagrams (as in the learning path) to determine relative phase amounts from the overall composition’s position along the tie line.
Why others are wrong: The lever rule is not restricted to eutectics; it applies wherever two phases coexist and a tie line can be drawn; the consolute point is where tie lines shrink to zero length, not where they uniquely exist.

4) Consider a binary solid–liquid phase diagram where an intermediate compound forms and undergoes incongruent melting (peritectic reaction). Which qualitative statement is most consistent with “incongruent melting” in such diagrams?

A. The solid melts to a liquid of the same composition as the solid at a single temperature.  
B. On heating, the solid decomposes to a liquid plus a different solid phase rather than producing a liquid of identical composition.  
C. The liquid and vapour compositions become identical at the melting point.  
D. The solid becomes completely miscible with the other solid phase at all temperatures.  

Correct answer: On heating, the solid decomposes to a liquid plus a different solid phase rather than producing a liquid of identical composition.

Explanation: The syllabus explicitly distinguishes congruent vs. incongruent melting as different solid-phase behaviors during melting in two-component systems.
Incongruent melting means the solid does not melt to a liquid of the same composition; instead it participates in a reaction (often peritectic) producing a liquid and another solid of different composition.
Why others are wrong: “Same composition liquid” defines congruent melting; “liquid and vapour identical” describes azeotropy (liquid–vapour), not melting; complete solid miscibility refers to solid solutions, not incongruent melting behavior.

5) A distillation column is used for a binary mixture that forms an azeotrope at the operating pressure. Which statement best captures why increasing the number of equilibrium stages (theoretical plates) alone cannot yield a product composition beyond the azeotrope?

A. Because at the azeotrope the system is at a triple point.  
B. Because at the azeotrope the relative volatility effectively becomes 1 since liquid and vapour compositions are identical.  
C. Because the phase rule forbids two phases in binary systems at constant pressure.  
D. Because the azeotrope corresponds to a eutectic point that blocks vapour formation.  

Correct answer: Because at the azeotrope the relative volatility effectively becomes 1 since liquid and vapour compositions are identical.

Explanation: Fractional distillation relies on vapour–liquid equilibrium giving a vapour composition different from the liquid composition (enrichment driven by differential volatility).
At an azeotrope, the liquid and vapour compositions are identical, so the driving force for separation vanishes and adding more equilibrium stages cannot cross that composition limit at the same pressure.
Why others are wrong: Triple point and eutectic are different equilibria (one-component three-phase; binary solid–liquid invariant) and do not explain distillation limits; the phase rule allows two phases in binary systems at constant pressure and is routinely used for such diagrams.
