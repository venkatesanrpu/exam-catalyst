1) In a relaxation experiment on the reversible reaction \(A \rightleftharpoons B\), the system is at equilibrium and then a small temperature-jump is applied. The measured relaxation time is \(\tau = 0.020\ \text{s}\). If independent equilibrium measurements give \(K = \dfrac{[B]_{\mathrm{eq}}}{[A]_{\mathrm{eq}}}=4.0\), what is the forward rate constant \(k_f\) (for \(A \to B\)) assuming first-order forward and reverse steps?

A. \(k_f = 10\ \text{s}^{-1}\)  
B. \(k_f = 20\ \text{s}^{-1}\)  
C. \(k_f = 40\ \text{s}^{-1}\)  
D. \(k_f = 50\ \text{s}^{-1}\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For a simple reversible first-order system, the relaxation rate is the sum of forward and reverse rate constants: \(\dfrac{1}{\tau}=k_f+k_r\).  Also, \(K=\dfrac{k_f}{k_r}\Rightarrow k_r=\dfrac{k_f}{K}\).  Hence \(\dfrac{1}{\tau}=k_f+\dfrac{k_f}{K}=k_f\left(1+\dfrac{1}{K}\right)\).  With \(\tau=0.020\ \text{s}\), \(\dfrac{1}{\tau}=50\ \text{s}^{-1}\), so \(k_f=\dfrac{50}{1+1/4}=\dfrac{50}{1.25}=40\ \text{s}^{-1}\); but note \(K=[B]/[A]=4\) implies \(k_f/k_r=4\), giving \(k_f=40\ \text{s}^{-1}\).  The option matching this is 40 s\(^{-1}\); therefore the correct choice is the one listing \(40\ \text{s}^{-1}\), while \(20\ \text{s}^{-1}\) would correspond to incorrectly using \(1/\tau=k_f\) only (ignoring the reverse step).

2) A stopped-flow instrument has a dead time of \(2.0\ \text{ms}\). A reaction has a characteristic half-life of \(0.50\ \text{ms}\). Which statement is most accurate regarding measurement of the early-time kinetics?

A. The reaction can be fully resolved because stopped-flow is designed for any fast reaction  
B. Only the tail end (post-dead-time) behavior can be observed; the earliest kinetics are missed  
C. The dead time is irrelevant because only equilibrium matters  
D. Relaxation methods and stopped-flow give identical information here  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In flow/rapid-mixing methods, dead time sets the earliest time point accessible after mixing, so processes faster than the dead time cannot be directly observed in their initial stage.  With \(t_{1/2}=0.50\ \text{ms}\) and dead time \(2.0\ \text{ms}\), multiple half-lives elapse before observation begins, so only later-time remnants of the kinetic trace are captured.  Assuming stopped-flow resolves “any” fast reaction ignores the instrument-response limitation emphasized for fast kinetics methods.  Relaxation methods differ conceptually from rapid-mixing methods (perturb equilibrium vs initiate reaction by mixing), so they are not automatically identical in information content.

3) For a diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction in solution, the Smoluchowski model predicts that increasing the solvent viscosity should generally:

A. Increase the rate constant because collisions become more frequent  
B. Decrease the diffusion-controlled rate constant because diffusion slows  
C. Leave the rate constant unchanged because activation energy dominates  
D. Make the reaction first order instead of second order  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In diffusion-controlled reactions, the limiting factor is how quickly reactants diffuse to encounter each other; higher viscosity typically lowers diffusion coefficients, reducing encounter rates.  The Smoluchowski framework explicitly treats the rate as diffusion-limited rather than activation-controlled, so viscosity changes matter strongly.  Claiming the rate constant is unchanged assumes activation control, which contradicts the definition of diffusion control.  Reaction order is governed by molecularity/kinetic scheme; diffusion control affects the magnitude of the bimolecular rate constant, not the fundamental order.

4) An excited singlet state \(S_1\) decays by fluorescence with rate constant \(k_f\) and by nonradiative internal conversion with rate constant \(k_{nr}\). If \(k_f = 2.0\times 10^8\ \text{s}^{-1}\) and \(k_{nr}=8.0\times 10^8\ \text{s}^{-1}\), what is the fluorescence quantum yield \(\Phi_f\)?

A. 0.20  
B. 0.25  
C. 0.50  
D. 0.80  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For competing first-order decay channels from an excited state, the quantum yield for fluorescence is \(\Phi_f=\dfrac{k_f}{k_f+k_{nr}}\).  Substituting gives \(\Phi_f=\dfrac{2.0}{2.0+8.0}=0.20\).  A value of 0.25 would result from an arithmetic slip (using 2/(8) instead of 2/(10)).  Larger values like 0.5 or 0.8 would incorrectly assume radiative decay dominates despite \(k_{nr}\) being larger.

5) A fluorophore shows dynamic quenching with quencher concentration \([Q]\). The Stern–Volmer plot of \(\dfrac{I_0}{I}\) vs \([Q]\) is linear with slope \(K_{SV}=10\ \text{M}^{-1}\). If \([Q]=0.20\ \text{M}\), what is \(\dfrac{I}{I_0}\) predicted by Stern–Volmer behavior?

A. 0.33  
B. 0.50  
C. 0.67  
D. 0.83  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Stern–Volmer analysis relates intensity quenching to quencher concentration as \(\dfrac{I_0}{I}=1+K_{SV}[Q]\) for a linear dynamic-quenching case.  Here \(\dfrac{I_0}{I}=1+10(0.20)=3\), so \(\dfrac{I}{I_0}=1/3\approx 0.33\); however note the question asks \(I/I_0\), which is 0.33.  The distractor 0.67 corresponds to mistakenly using \(I/I_0=1+K_{SV}[Q]\) instead of its inverse.  Values like 0.50 or 0.83 are typical of underestimating the quenching effect or using the wrong slope–intercept interpretation.

6) A photochemical reaction has quantum yield \(\Phi = 0.60\). If the absorbed photon rate is \(R_{\text{abs}} = 2.0\times 10^{-6}\ \text{einstein s}^{-1}\), what is the rate of product formation (in \(\text{einstein s}^{-1}\)) for a primary photochemical process?

A. \(1.2\times 10^{-6}\)  
B. \(2.0\times 10^{-6}\)  
C. \(3.3\times 10^{-6}\)  
D. \(0.8\times 10^{-6}\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Quantum yield is defined as events per photon absorbed, so the event (product-formation) rate is \(R_{\text{prod}}=\Phi\,R_{\text{abs}}\).  Thus \(R_{\text{prod}}=0.60\times 2.0\times 10^{-6}=1.2\times 10^{-6}\ \text{einstein s}^{-1}\).  Taking \(R_{\text{prod}}=R_{\text{abs}}\) would incorrectly assume \(\Phi=1\).  A larger value like \(3.3\times 10^{-6}\) would correspond to \(\Phi>1\), which is possible for chain photoreactions but not for a single-step primary process unless chain amplification is present.

7) A chain photoreaction shows an experimentally measured quantum yield of 12. Which interpretation is most consistent?

A. More than one product molecule is formed per photon absorbed due to chain propagation steps  
B. The sample is not absorbing any photons  
C. The excited state decays only by fluorescence  
D. The reaction must be diffusion-controlled  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Quantum yields greater than unity are characteristic of chain photoreactions, where one absorbed photon initiates a sequence of propagation steps producing many product molecules.  If the sample were not absorbing photons, a meaningful quantum yield could not be established for photochemical conversion.  Pure fluorescence deactivation would reduce chemical quantum yield rather than increase it above 1.  Diffusion control concerns encounter-limited bimolecular rates in solution and is not the defining reason for \(\Phi \gg 1\).

8) In selecting a method to study a very fast reaction, which pairing is most appropriate?

A. Millisecond kinetics → conventional manual mixing and titration  
B. Microsecond kinetics → stopped-flow or relaxation techniques  
C. Minute kinetics → laser flash photolysis only  
D. Nanosecond kinetics → simple colorimetry with cuvette mixing  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Matching reaction timescales to instrumental response is central in fast kinetics; microsecond regimes often require rapid-mixing/flow methods or relaxation methods rather than conventional techniques.  Manual mixing and titration generally cannot resolve millisecond transients due to mixing and detection limitations.  Laser flash photolysis is suited to producing/monitoring very short-lived transients but is not the only tool for minute-scale kinetics.  Nanosecond kinetics cannot be followed by simple cuvette mixing because the mixing and detection times are far too slow.

9) A system at equilibrium is perturbed by an electric-field jump and the observable relaxes exponentially back with a single relaxation time. Which key parameter(s) can be obtained from such relaxation data for a simple reversible process?

A. Only the equilibrium constant, never rate constants  
B. The sum of forward and reverse rate constants (and with \(K\), individual rate constants)  
C. Only the diffusion coefficient of reactants  
D. Only the activation energy without any additional data  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Relaxation methods monitor return to equilibrium after a perturbation and allow extraction of relaxation time, which is related to the kinetic rate parameters for reversible schemes.  For a simple reversible case, relaxation time depends on the forward and reverse rate constants; combining relaxation data with equilibrium information allows separation of individual rate constants.  Diffusion coefficients are central to diffusion-controlled models, but relaxation experiments primarily report kinetic relaxation back to equilibrium, not diffusion alone.  Activation energy requires temperature dependence measurements; a single relaxation trace does not uniquely provide it.

10) A transient intermediate is produced by a short light pulse and monitored spectroscopically over time. Which technique is being described?

A. Stopped-flow spectroscopy  
B. Laser flash photolysis  
C. Pressure-jump relaxation  
D. Continuous-flow mixing  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A pulsed light source creating transient species followed by time-resolved monitoring is the defining operational picture of laser flash photolysis.  Stopped-flow and continuous-flow are rapid-mixing approaches that initiate reactions by mixing, not by a light pulse.  Pressure-jump is a relaxation (equilibrium perturbation) method and does not inherently rely on generating transients by photopulses.
