1) In Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling, the total angular momentum quantum number \(J\) is obtained by:
A. Vector addition of \(L\) and \(S\), giving \(J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \dots, L+S\)  
B. Simple arithmetic sum \(J=L+S\) only  
C. Product of \(L\) and \(S\), i.e., \(J=LS\)  
D. Difference \(J=L-S\) only  

Correct answer: Vector addition of \(L\) and \(S\), giving \(J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \dots, L+S\)   

Explanation: In LS coupling, orbital angular momenta combine to give total \(L\), spins combine to give total \(S\), and then \(L\) and \(S\) couple to give the total angular momentum \(J\).  Quantum mechanically, vector addition permitsits multiple \(J\) values from \(|L-S|\) up to \(L+S\) in integer steps, which is central to building atomic term levels.  The single-value forms \(J=L+S\) or \(J=L-S\) ignore the allowed range, and \(J=LS\) has no basis in angular momentum coupling rules. 

2) A term symbol \(^{2S+1}L_J\) directly indicates that \(2S+1\) is the:
A. Spin multiplicity  
B. Orbital multiplicity  
C. Number of electrons in the valence shell  
D. Principal quantum number of the highest electron  

Correct answer: Spin multiplicity

Explanation: In term symbols, \(^{2S+1}\) is the spin multiplicity, determined by total spin \(S\), and it tells how many spin states correspond to the term.  This is a foundational label used along with \(L\) (S, P, D, F, …) and \(J\) to describe atomic energy levels in spectroscopy.  It is not tied to electron count directly, nor to the principal quantum number, and “orbital multiplicity” is not the meaning of \(2S+1\).

3) For an electric dipole allowed atomic transition (in LS coupling), the change in orbital angular momentum quantum number typically follows:
A. \(\Delta L = \pm 1\)  
B. \(\Delta L = 0\) only  
C. \(\Delta L = \pm 2\)  
D. \(\Delta L = \pm 3\)  

Correct answer: \(\Delta L = \pm 1\)

Explanation: Electric dipole selection rules originate from the symmetry of the transition dipole moment integral and, in LS coupling, one key consequence is that \(L\) must change by one unit for an allowed transition.  This is why many strong atomic lines correspond to S↔P, P↔D, D↔F, etc.  The options \(\Delta L=0\), \(\pm2\), or \(\pm3\) correspond to forbidden (or much weaker, higher-multipole) cases under the electric dipole approximation.

4) In pure rotational microwave spectroscopy of a rigid diatomic molecule, the main selection rule for rotational transitions is:
A. \(\Delta J = \pm 1\)  
B. \(\Delta J = 0\)  
C. \(\Delta J = \pm 2\)  
D. \(\Delta J = \pm 3\)  

Correct answer: \(\Delta J = \pm 1\)

Explanation: For a rigid rotor, rotational energy levels are labeled by \(J\), and absorption/emission of a photon in a dipole-allowed rotational transition changes \(J\) by one unit.  This is the core rule used to index rotational spectral lines and extract rotational constants from spacing patterns.  Transitions with \(\Delta J=0\) do not change rotational state, and \(\Delta J=\pm2,\pm3\) correspond to different mechanisms (e.g., Raman or higher-order processes), not the basic dipole rotational spectrum.

5) Infrared (vibrational) absorption of a harmonic oscillator most fundamentally follows the selection rule:
A. \(\Delta v = \pm 1\)  
B. \(\Delta v = 0\) only  
C. \(\Delta v = \pm 2\) only  
D. \(\Delta v\) can be any integer with equal probability  

Correct answer: \(\Delta v = \pm 1\)

Explanation: In the harmonic oscillator approximation, the vibrational transition moment leads to the fundamental selection rule \(\Delta v=\pm1\), producing the dominant fundamental IR band.  Overtones (\(\Delta v=\pm2,\pm3,\dots\)) become noticeable mainly when anharmonicity is included, which goes beyond the ideal harmonic model.  Therefore \(\Delta v=0\) is not an absorption transition, and “any integer with equal probability” contradicts the quantum-mechanical transition moment constraints.

6) Raman spectroscopy differs from IR absorption primarily because Raman activity requires a change in the molecule’s:
A. Polarizability during the vibration/rotation  
B. Permanent dipole moment during the vibration/rotation  
C. Net molecular charge  
D. Number of nuclei  

Correct answer: Polarizability during the vibration/rotation

Explanation: Raman scattering intensity is governed by how the polarizability tensor changes with the vibrational (or rotational) coordinate, which sets Raman selection rules and activity.  In contrast, IR absorption requires a change in dipole moment with the vibrational coordinate, so many modes can be IR-inactive but Raman-active (and vice versa).  Net charge and number of nuclei do not define Raman activity, and a permanent dipole is not the key requirement for Raman transitions.

7) In Raman scattering, compared to the incident light frequency, the Stokes line occurs at:
A. Lower frequency (longer wavelength)  
B. Higher frequency (shorter wavelength)  
C. The same frequency (no shift)  
D. Random frequency unrelated to molecular energy levels  

Correct answer: Lower frequency (longer wavelength)

Explanation: In Stokes Raman scattering, the molecule gains energy (ends in an excited rotational/vibrational level), so the scattered photon loses that energy and appears at lower frequency than the incident radiation.  Anti-Stokes lines are the opposite case, where the molecule starts excited and the scattered photon gains energy.  Rayleigh scattering corresponds to no shift, and Raman shifts are directly connected to molecular energy level spacings, not random.

8) Einstein \(A\) coefficient in spectroscopy is most directly associated with:
A. Spontaneous emission probability per unit time  
B. Stimulated absorption probability per unit time  
C. Collisional (pressure) broadening rate  
D. Doppler broadening due to temperature  

Correct answer: Spontaneous emission probability per unit time

Explanation: Einstein coefficients describe radiative transition probabilities, where \(A\) corresponds to spontaneous emission from an upper state to a lower state.  The \(B\) coefficients relate to stimulated absorption and stimulated emission in the presence of radiation, not \(A\).  Pressure broadening and Doppler broadening are line-shape mechanisms, not the definition of Einstein \(A\).

9) Doppler broadening of a spectral line is primarily caused by:
A. Thermal motion of atoms/molecules producing a velocity distribution  
B. Finite lifetime of the excited state (uncertainty principle)  
C. Collisions between particles at high pressure  
D. Instrumental slit width only  

Correct answer: Thermal motion of atoms/molecules producing a velocity distribution

Explanation: Doppler broadening arises because moving emitters/absorbers see a shifted frequency depending on their velocity component along the line of sight, and thermal motion creates a distribution of velocities that spreads the line.  Lifetime broadening is the “natural” broadening mechanism tied to finite state lifetimes, and collisions cause pressure (collisional) broadening—both distinct from Doppler effects.  Instrument resolution can broaden observed lines, but it is not the physical origin of Doppler broadening.

10) In basic NMR, the resonance (Larmor) condition connects the angular frequency \(\omega_0\) to the magnetic field \(B_0\) via:
A. \(\omega_0 = \gamma B_0\)  
B. \(\omega_0 = \dfrac{B_0}{\gamma}\)  
C. \(\omega_0 = \gamma^2 B_0\)  
D. \(\omega_0 = \dfrac{\gamma}{B_0}\)  

Correct answer: \(\omega_0 = \gamma B_0\)

Explanation: In NMR, a nucleus with gyromagnetic ratio \(\gamma\) precesses in a static magnetic field \(B_0\) at the Larmor angular frequency \(\omega_0\), giving the resonance condition \(\omega_0=\gamma B_0\).  This relationship is central to understanding why higher magnetic fields increase the resonance frequency and typically improve spectral dispersion.  The other expressions invert or distort the proportionality and do not match the fundamental Larmor precession relation used in NMR theory.
