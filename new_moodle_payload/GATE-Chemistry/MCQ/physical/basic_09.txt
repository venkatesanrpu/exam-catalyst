1) In statistical thermodynamics, a **microstate** is best described as:
A. A macroscopic condition specified by \(P, V, T\)  
B. A single detailed specification of the system at the microscopic level consistent with given constraints  
C. The average energy of an ensemble at equilibrium  
D. The partition function value at a given temperature  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: A microstate refers to one specific microscopic configuration of a system (e.g., a particular arrangement of particles/energies/coordinates) that is consistent with the imposed macroscopic constraints.
The macroscopic condition \(P, V, T\) describes a macrostate, not a microstate.
The average energy is an ensemble average (a derived quantity), not a specification of a single configuration.
The partition function is a generating/normalization quantity for probabilities in the canonical description, not a definition of a microstate.

2) The **macrostate** of a system is most directly specified by:
A. A complete list of all particle positions and momenta  
B. A probability for each microstate  
C. A small set of thermodynamic variables (constraints) that can correspond to many microstates  
D. The chemical potential of the system only  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: A macrostate is defined by macroscopic observables/constraints (such as \(E,V,N\) or \(T,V,N\)), and many microstates can realize the same macrostate.
A complete list of positions and momenta describes one microstate.
A probability distribution over microstates is part of an ensemble description, not the definition of a macrostate itself.
Chemical potential alone is insufficient to specify a macrostate in general; additional variables/constraints are needed.

3) The statistical definition of entropy (Boltzmann formula) is:
A. \(S = k_B \ln W\)  
B. \(S = -k_B T \ln Z\)  
C. \(S = -(\partial \ln Z/\partial \beta)\)  
D. \(S = k_B \ln Z\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Boltzmann’s formula connects entropy to multiplicity \(W\) (number of accessible microstates) via \(S = k_B \ln W\).
\(-k_B T \ln Z\) corresponds to Helmholtz free energy \(F\), not entropy.
\(-(\partial \ln Z/\partial \beta)\) gives internal energy \(U\) in the canonical ensemble, not entropy directly.
\(k_B \ln Z\) is not the entropy; \(Z\) is the canonical partition function and entropy requires additional derivatives/relations.

4) The **microcanonical ensemble** is appropriate for a system that is:
A. In contact with a heat bath at fixed \(T\)  
B. Isolated with fixed \(E, V, N\)  
C. In contact with a particle reservoir at fixed \(\mu\)  
D. At fixed pressure and temperature  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The microcanonical ensemble describes isolated systems with fixed energy \(E\), volume \(V\), and particle number \(N\).
Contact with a heat bath implies canonical conditions (\(T,V,N\)).
Contact with a particle reservoir with fixed chemical potential \(\mu\) is grand canonical.
Fixed pressure and temperature corresponds to other ensembles (not the microcanonical ensemble described in this unit).

5) In the microcanonical ensemble, the postulate of **equal a priori probability** means:
A. All microstates (accessible under the given constraints) are equally probable  
B. The lowest-energy microstate is the most probable  
C. The probability of a microstate is proportional to \(e^{-\beta E}\)  
D. Probability depends only on the degeneracy of energy levels in the canonical ensemble  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Equal a priori probability states that for an isolated system with fixed \(E,V,N\), every accessible microstate consistent with these constraints has the same probability.
Choosing the lowest-energy microstate as most probable is not correct because energy is fixed in the microcanonical ensemble, and no Boltzmann weighting is used.
The factor \(e^{-\beta E}\) is the Boltzmann factor from the canonical ensemble, not microcanonical.
Degeneracy matters for counting \(W\), but the statement in option D mixes canonical ideas and is not the microcanonical postulate.

6) The **canonical ensemble** describes a system with fixed:
A. \(T, V, N\)  
B. \(E, V, N\)  
C. \(T, V, \mu\)  
D. \(P, T, N\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: In the canonical ensemble, the system exchanges energy with a heat reservoir, so temperature \(T\) is fixed along with \(V\) and \(N\), while the system energy fluctuates.
Fixed \(E,V,N\) is microcanonical.
Fixed \(T,V,\mu\) is grand canonical.
Fixed \(P,T,N\) is not the canonical ensemble as defined here.

7) The **Boltzmann distribution** in the canonical ensemble states that the probability of occupying a state of energy \(E_i\) is proportional to:
A. \(E_i\)  
B. \(e^{-\beta E_i}\)  
C. \(e^{+\beta E_i}\)  
D. \(\ln E_i\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The Boltzmann distribution assigns probabilities \(p_i \propto e^{-\beta E_i}\), where \(\beta = 1/(k_B T)\).
Direct proportionality to \(E_i\) is incorrect; higher energy states are typically less probable at fixed \(T\).
\(e^{+\beta E_i}\) would incorrectly favor higher energies and does not represent equilibrium canonical probabilities.
\(\ln E_i\) has no role as the weighting factor in the canonical probability distribution.

8) In the canonical ensemble, the **partition function** \(Z\) is defined as:
A. \(Z=\sum_i E_i\)  
B. \(Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}\)  
C. \(Z=\prod_i e^{-\beta E_i}\)  
D. \(Z=\sum_i \beta E_i\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The canonical partition function is \(Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}\), summing the Boltzmann factors over all microstates (or energy eigenstates).
Summing energies \(\sum_i E_i\) is not a normalization and does not generate thermodynamics.
A product form \(\prod_i e^{-\beta E_i}\) is not the definition of the canonical partition function.
\(\sum_i \beta E_i\) is not dimensionally or conceptually the canonical partition function.

9) The **Helmholtz free energy** \(F\) is related to the canonical partition function by:
A. \(F = k_B T \ln Z\)  
B. \(F = -k_B T \ln Z\)  
C. \(F = -\partial \ln Z/\partial \beta\)  
D. \(F = k_B \ln Z\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In the canonical ensemble, the Helmholtz free energy is given by \(F = -k_B T \ln Z\), making \(Z\) the central generating function for thermodynamic properties.
The expression \(k_B T \ln Z\) has the wrong sign and would give incorrect temperature dependence.
\(-\partial \ln Z/\partial \beta\) corresponds to internal energy \(U\), not \(F\).
\(k_B \ln Z\) misses the factor of \(T\) and does not represent Helmholtz free energy.

10) The **grand canonical ensemble** is characterized by fixed \(T\), \(V\), and:
A. \(E\)  
B. \(N\)  
C. \(\mu\)  
D. \(S\)  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: The grand canonical ensemble applies when a system can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir, so \(T\), \(V\), and chemical potential \(\mu\) are fixed while \(E\) and \(N\) fluctuate.
Fixed \(E\) would correspond to an isolated-energy constraint (microcanonical-like), not grand canonical.
Fixed \(N\) corresponds to the canonical ensemble rather than grand canonical.
Entropy \(S\) is not taken as a fixed control variable for defining the grand canonical ensemble in this context.
