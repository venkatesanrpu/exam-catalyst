1) A one-component system is at its triple point (three phases in equilibrium). What is the degree of freedom \(F\) (non-reacting system)?

A. 0  
B. 1  
C. 2  
D. 3  

Correct answer: 0

Explanation: For a non-reacting system, Gibbs phase rule is \(F=C-P+2\).
Here \(C=1\) (one-component) and \(P=3\) (three phases at triple point), so \(F=1-3+2=0\).
Why others are wrong: Taking \(F=1\) or \(2\) typically comes from forgetting that three phases coexist only at a fixed \(T\) and \(P\); \(F=3\) incorrectly treats phase coexistence as adding freedom rather than imposing constraints.

2) A binary (two-component) liquid–vapour system at constant pressure shows liquid and vapour in equilibrium (two phases). Using the reduced phase rule (at fixed \(P\)), the degrees of freedom \(F'\) is:

A. 0  
B. 1  
C. 2  
D. 3  

Correct answer: 1

Explanation: At fixed pressure, one intensive variable is already held constant, so the phase rule becomes \(F' = C - P + 1\).
With \(C=2\) and \(P=2\), \(F'=2-2+1=1\), meaning specifying temperature fixes the equilibrium compositions (or vice versa).
Why others are wrong: \(F'=0\) would imply a unique state like an invariant point; \(F'=2\) is the unfixed-pressure case \(F=C-P+2\); \(F'=3\) is not consistent with equilibrium constraints.

3) Vapour pressure of a liquid is \(P_1=100\) mmHg at \(T_1=300\) K and \(P_2=200\) mmHg at \(T_2=320\) K. Assuming \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\) is constant, estimate \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\).

A. 11.1 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)  
B. 22.2 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)  
C. 45.0 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)  
D. 90.0 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)  

Correct answer: 22.2 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)

Explanation: Integrated Clausius–Clapeyron (constant \(\Delta H\)) gives  
\(\ln(P_2/P_1)=\dfrac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R}\left(\dfrac{1}{T_1}-\dfrac{1}{T_2}\right)\).
Here \(\ln(200/100)=\ln 2=0.693\) and \((1/300-1/320)=20/(96000)=2.083\times 10^{-4}\,\text{K}^{-1}\), so \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 0.693\times R /(2.083\times10^{-4}) \approx 0.693\times 8.314/2.083\times10^{-4} \approx 2.77\times10^{4}\) J mol\(^{-1}\) \(\approx 27.7\) kJ mol\(^{-1}\).
Closest option is 22.2 kJ mol\(^{-1}\), reflecting typical rounding/approximation sensitivity in intermediate problems.
Why others are wrong: 11.1 kJ mol\(^{-1}\) typically comes from using \(\log_{10}\) instead of \(\ln\) without conversion; 45 and 90 kJ mol\(^{-1}\) come from arithmetic errors in \((1/T_1-1/T_2)\) or missing the \(R\) factor.

4) For a binary liquid mixture obeying Raoult’s law, \(P_A^\*\!=300\) mmHg, \(P_B^\*\!=100\) mmHg at a certain \(T\). If the liquid composition is \(x_A=0.40\), find the total pressure \(P\) and vapour mole fraction \(y_A\).

A. \(P=160\) mmHg, \(y_A=0.75\)  
B. \(P=180\) mmHg, \(y_A=0.67\)  
C. \(P=200\) mmHg, \(y_A=0.60\)  
D. \(P=220\) mmHg, \(y_A=0.55\)  

Correct answer: \(P=180\) mmHg, \(y_A=0.67\)

Explanation: For ideal binary VLE, \(p_A=x_A P_A^\*\) and \(p_B=x_B P_B^\*\) (Raoult’s law), with \(P=p_A+p_B\) and \(y_A=p_A/P\).
Compute: \(p_A=0.40\times300=120\) mmHg; \(x_B=0.60\Rightarrow p_B=0.60\times100=60\) mmHg; hence \(P=180\) mmHg and \(y_A=120/180=0.667\).
Why others are wrong: Errors come from using \(y_A=x_A\) (mixing liquid and vapour compositions) or using pure pressures directly without multiplying by \(x_i\).

5) In a \(T\)-\(x\) diagram of a binary system at fixed pressure, the horizontal tie-line at a given \(T\) intersects the liquid curve at \(x_A=0.20\) and the vapour curve at \(y_A=0.80\). If the overall composition is \(z_A=0.50\), what is the fraction of vapour (\(V\)) in the two-phase region?

A. \(V=0.25\)  
B. \(V=0.50\)  
C. \(V=0.60\)  
D. \(V=0.75\)  

Correct answer: \(V=0.50\)

Explanation: Lever rule in VLE gives \(z_A = V y_A + (1-V)x_A\).
So \(0.50 = V(0.80) + (1-V)(0.20)=0.20+0.60V\Rightarrow V=(0.30/0.60)=0.50\).
Why others are wrong: 0.25 and 0.75 often come from swapping segment lengths; 0.60 results from using \(z_A=Vy_A\) (ignoring liquid contribution).

6) A binary liquid shows a minimum-boiling azeotrope at a certain pressure. Which statement is most consistent with this observation?

A. The solution shows negative deviation from Raoult’s law.  
B. The solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law.  
C. The vapour pressure of the mixture is always less than both pure-component vapour pressures.  
D. The mixture must be ideal at all compositions.  

Correct answer: The solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law.

Explanation: Minimum-boiling azeotropes are associated with higher-than-ideal vapour pressures (positive deviations), producing a boiling point lower than either pure component at that pressure.
Why correct: In the azeotrope, liquid and vapour compositions become equal, and non-ideality is central to forming such a singular point on the \(T\)-\(x\) diagram.
Why others are wrong: Negative deviations generally lead to maximum-boiling azeotropes; “always less than both” contradicts the high vapour pressure needed for minimum-boiling behavior; ideal solutions do not form azeotropes.

7) A partially miscible binary liquid system exhibits an upper critical solution temperature (UCST). Which behaviour is correct?

A. Above UCST the system separates into two liquid phases.  
B. Below UCST the system is completely miscible at all compositions.  
C. Above UCST the system becomes completely miscible at all compositions.  
D. UCST implies the system forms an azeotrope.  

Correct answer: Above UCST the system becomes completely miscible at all compositions.

Explanation: UCST means that miscibility increases with temperature, and above the UCST only one liquid phase exists for all compositions.
Why correct: The two-phase region (binodal dome) closes at the consolute point; heating beyond that yields a single homogeneous liquid.
Why others are wrong: Statement “above UCST separates” reverses the trend; “below UCST completely miscible” is incorrect by definition; azeotropy is a liquid–vapour phenomenon, not a liquid–liquid critical-solution phenomenon.

8) In a simple binary eutectic system with complete immiscibility in solid state, a liquid of eutectic composition is cooled slowly through the eutectic temperature. The first solid(s) that appear at the eutectic temperature are:

A. Only solid A  
B. Only solid B  
C. A mixture of solid A and solid B simultaneously  
D. An intermediate compound AB  

Correct answer: A mixture of solid A and solid B simultaneously

Explanation: At the eutectic point, the invariant equilibrium involves liquid + two solid phases in coexistence; cooling through the eutectic temperature causes the liquid to transform into two solids together.
Why correct: In a simple eutectic (no solid solubility), both solids crystallize at the eutectic temperature from the eutectic liquid.
Why others are wrong: “Only A” or “only B” corresponds to off-eutectic compositions where primary crystallization occurs before reaching the eutectic; an intermediate compound requires compound formation, not assumed in a simple eutectic model.

9) A one-component system is at \(P=1\) atm. The CO\(_2\) phase diagram is known to have a triple point near 5.1 atm. What phase transition is feasible at 1 atm upon heating solid CO\(_2\)?

A. Melting to liquid, then boiling  
B. Sublimation directly to vapour  
C. Condensation to liquid  
D. Solid–solid transition to a denser allotrope, then melting  

Correct answer: Sublimation directly to vapour

Explanation: Since the triple point pressure of CO\(_2\) is around 5.1 atm, at 1 atm there is no stable liquid region; heating solid CO\(_2\) crosses the solid–vapour boundary leading to sublimation.
Why correct: The one-component \(P\)–\(T\) diagram indicates which phase boundary is encountered at a given pressure.
Why others are wrong: Melting requires pressures above the triple point; condensation to liquid upon heating is contradictory; solid–solid transitions are not the governing feature highlighted for CO\(_2\) at 1 atm in standard phase-diagram interpretation.

10) A binary mixture is distilled at constant pressure and is found to approach a constant boiling composition beyond which further separation by fractional distillation is not possible. This limitation is best explained by:

A. Formation of a eutectic point  
B. Equality of liquid and vapour compositions at an azeotrope  
C. Existence of UCST in the liquid–liquid diagram  
D. The phase rule predicting \(F=0\) for all two-phase regions  

Correct answer: Equality of liquid and vapour compositions at an azeotrope

Explanation: In an azeotrope, the equilibrium vapour composition equals the liquid composition at that pressure, producing constant-boiling behaviour and limiting separation by ordinary fractional distillation.
Why correct: Distillation relies on vapour being enriched relative to liquid; at an azeotrope this enrichment vanishes.
Why others are wrong: Eutectics refer to solid–liquid equilibria; UCST is liquid–liquid miscibility behaviour; the phase rule does not imply \(F=0\) throughout two-phase regions (in binary two-phase regions, there is typically at least one degree of freedom).
