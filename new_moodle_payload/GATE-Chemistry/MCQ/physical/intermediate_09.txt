1) A system has two non-degenerate energy levels: \(E_0=0\) and \(E_1=\varepsilon\). In the canonical ensemble at temperature \(T\), the ratio of populations \(p_1/p_0\) is:
A. \(e^{+\beta \varepsilon}\)  
B. \(e^{-\beta \varepsilon}\)  
C. \(\beta \varepsilon\)  
D. \(1-\beta \varepsilon\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In the canonical ensemble, probabilities follow the Boltzmann distribution \(p_i \propto e^{-\beta E_i}\), where \(\beta = 1/(k_B T)\).
Thus \(p_1/p_0 = e^{-\beta(E_1-E_0)} = e^{-\beta \varepsilon}\).
The positive exponent would incorrectly predict more population in the higher level at low \(T\).
The linear forms \(\beta\varepsilon\) and \(1-\beta\varepsilon\) are not valid population ratios (they resemble crude expansions and can even become negative).

2) For the same two-level system (\(E_0=0\), \(E_1=\varepsilon\)), the canonical partition function \(Z\) is:
A. \(Z = 1 + e^{+\beta \varepsilon}\)  
B. \(Z = 1 + e^{-\beta \varepsilon}\)  
C. \(Z = e^{-\beta \varepsilon}\)  
D. \(Z = 1 - e^{-\beta \varepsilon}\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: By definition, \(Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}\).
Here, \(Z=e^{-\beta\cdot 0}+e^{-\beta\varepsilon}=1+e^{-\beta\varepsilon}\).
Using \(e^{+\beta\varepsilon}\) flips the sign in the Boltzmann factor, violating canonical statistics.
Options C and D omit the ground-state contribution or use an unphysical subtraction.

3) For a canonical ensemble, internal energy is obtained from the partition function as:
A. \(U = -\dfrac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}\)  
B. \(U = -k_B T \ln Z\)  
C. \(U = k_B T \ln Z\)  
D. \(U = \dfrac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta}\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: The canonical result relating thermodynamics to \(Z\) is \(U = -\partial(\ln Z)/\partial \beta\).
\(-k_B T\ln Z\) gives Helmholtz free energy \(F\), not \(U\).
\(k_B T\ln Z\) has the wrong sign even for \(F\), so it cannot represent \(U\).
\(\partial Z/\partial\beta\) is not directly \(U\); the logarithm is essential because probabilities are normalized by \(Z\).

4) For the two-level system (\(E_0=0\), \(E_1=\varepsilon\)) in the canonical ensemble, the probability of finding the system in the excited state is:
A. \(p_1=\dfrac{e^{-\beta \varepsilon}}{1+e^{-\beta \varepsilon}}\)  
B. \(p_1=\dfrac{e^{+\beta \varepsilon}}{1+e^{+\beta \varepsilon}}\)  
C. \(p_1=\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\beta \varepsilon}}\)  
D. \(p_1=\dfrac{1}{1+\beta \varepsilon}\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Canonical probabilities are \(p_i = e^{-\beta E_i}/Z\) with \(Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}\).
So \(p_1 = e^{-\beta\varepsilon}/(1+e^{-\beta\varepsilon})\).
Option C is actually \(p_0\) (ground-state probability).
Option B uses the wrong sign in the Boltzmann factor, and option D is not derived from partition-function normalization.

5) A system is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, but the number of particles is strictly fixed. The most appropriate ensemble is:
A. Microcanonical  
B. Canonical  
C. Grand canonical  
D. No ensemble applies because energy fluctuates  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Thermal contact with a reservoir fixes \(T\) while allowing energy exchange (energy fluctuations), and fixed particle number implies fixed \(N\); together this is the canonical ensemble (\(T,V,N\) fixed).
Microcanonical would require isolation with fixed \(E,V,N\).
Grand canonical would be used if both energy and particles could be exchanged (fixed \(T,V,\mu\)).
Energy fluctuations are expected in canonical ensemble and do not invalidate the ensemble description.

6) A small subsystem can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at fixed \(T\) and \(\mu\). The correct weight factor for a microstate with energy \(E\) and particle number \(N\) is proportional to:
A. \(e^{-\beta E}\)  
B. \(e^{-\beta (E-\mu N)}\)  
C. \(e^{-\beta (E+\mu N)}\)  
D. \(e^{+\beta (E-\mu N)}\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: In the grand canonical ensemble, probabilities are proportional to \(e^{-\beta(E-\mu N)}\), reflecting exchange of both energy and particles with the reservoir.
Option A is the canonical Boltzmann factor (no particle exchange).
Option C has the wrong sign for \(\mu N\), leading to incorrect dependence of probability on particle number.
Option D flips the overall sign and would favor large \(E-\mu N\), contradicting equilibrium statistics.

7) The grand partition function \(\Xi\) is defined as:
A. \(\Xi=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}\)  
B. \(\Xi=\sum_N \sum_i e^{-\beta(E_{iN}-\mu N)}\)  
C. \(\Xi=\sum_N \sum_i e^{-\beta(E_{iN}+\mu N)}\)  
D. \(\Xi=\prod_N \sum_i e^{-\beta(E_{iN}-\mu N)}\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: The grand partition function sums over both particle numbers \(N\) and microstates \(i\) at each \(N\): \(\Xi=\sum_N \sum_i e^{-\beta(E_{iN}-\mu N)}\).
Option A is the canonical partition function \(Z\), not \(\Xi\).
Option C uses the wrong sign convention for the \(\mu N\) term in the exponent.
Option D incorrectly replaces a sum over \(N\) by a product and changes the ensemble definition.

8) In the canonical ensemble, Helmholtz free energy \(F\) is connected to the partition function via:
A. \(F = -k_B T \ln Z\)  
B. \(F = -\dfrac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}\)  
C. \(F = k_B \ln Z\)  
D. \(F = k_B T Z\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Canonical thermodynamics gives \(F=-k_B T\ln Z\).
\(-\partial\ln Z/\partial\beta\) corresponds to internal energy \(U\), not \(F\).
\(k_B\ln Z\) misses the factor \(T\) and does not have the correct thermodynamic meaning.
\(k_B T Z\) is dimensionally inconsistent and not a standard thermodynamic relation.

9) In a microcanonical description, entropy is expressed in terms of the multiplicity (density of accessible states) \(\Omega\) as:
A. \(S(E,V,N)=k_B \ln \Omega(E,V,N)\)  
B. \(S(E,V,N)=k_B \Omega(E,V,N)\)  
C. \(S(E,V,N)=-k_B \ln \Omega(E,V,N)\)  
D. \(S(E,V,N)=\Omega(E,V,N)/k_B\)  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: The microcanonical entropy is defined by \(S(E,V,N)=k_B \ln \Omega(E,V,N)\), consistent with the statistical definition of entropy.
Not taking the logarithm (option B) breaks the additive property of entropy for independent subsystems.
The negative sign (option C) would make entropy decrease with increasing number of accessible states, contradicting the probabilistic interpretation.
Dividing by \(k_B\) (option D) is dimensionally wrong and not the entropy definition.

10) In canonical calculations, a common mistake is to compute the average energy as \(\sum_i E_i\) without weighting. The correct ensemble-average internal energy is:
A. \(U=\sum_i E_i\)  
B. \(U=\sum_i p_i E_i\) with \(p_i=\dfrac{e^{-\beta E_i}}{Z}\)  
C. \(U=\prod_i p_i E_i\)  
D. \(U=\sum_i \ln(p_i E_i)\)  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Canonical ensemble averages must be probability-weighted: \(U=\langle E\rangle = \sum_i p_i E_i\), where \(p_i=e^{-\beta E_i}/Z\) comes from the Boltzmann distribution and partition-function normalization.
Unweighted sums ignore the fact that high-energy states are less probable at finite temperature.
Products of probabilities and energies or logarithmic combinations are not definitions of ensemble averages.
