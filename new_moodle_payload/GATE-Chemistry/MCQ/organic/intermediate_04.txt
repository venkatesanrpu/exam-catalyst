Here are 10 intermediate-level GATE Organic Chemistry MCQs (2-mark style) based on the attached “GATE Organic Synthesis Learning Path” (organic_unit_04.txt). Each question requires short calculations, multi-concept correlation, or careful mechanistic reasoning across alkenes/alkynes, aromatics, alcohols/phenols, carbonyls, carboxylic acid derivatives, halides/nitro, amines/amides, organometallics, and selective synthesis planning.

1) Hydration strategy check: 1-methylcyclohexene is subjected to (i) oxymercuration–demercuration (Hg(OAc)2/H2O; NaBH4) or (ii) hydroboration–oxidation (BH3·THF; H2O2/NaOH). Which pair of major alcohols is expected?  
A. Both give trans-2-methylcyclohexanol  
B. (i) 1-methylcyclohexanol; (ii) trans-2-methylcyclohexanol  
C. (i) trans-2-methylcyclohexanol; (ii) 1-methylcyclohexanol  
D. Both give 1-methylcyclohexanol  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Oxymercuration–demercuration gives Markovnikov hydration without rearrangement, leading to tertiary alcohol formation at the more substituted carbon (1-methylcyclohexanol). Hydroboration–oxidation delivers anti-Markovnikov hydration with syn addition across the double bond; on cyclohexenes, this gives substitution at the less substituted carbon with overall syn addition, consistent with trans-2-methylcyclohexanol after ring conformational analysis. Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov and syn vs anti outcomes are core to alkene hydration strategies.

2) Alkyne reduction selectivity: A terminal alkyne is treated under two conditions: (i) H2, Lindlar catalyst; (ii) Na/NH3(l), −78 °C. Which pair of alkene stereoisomers results?  
A. (i) E-alkene; (ii) Z-alkene  
B. (i) Z-alkene; (ii) E-alkene  
C. Both give E-alkene  
D. Both give Z-alkene  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Lindlar catalyst poisons the surface enabling syn hydrogenation of alkynes to Z-alkenes. Dissolving metal reduction proceeds via radical-anion steps and anti addition, affording E-alkenes. These complementary methods are standard for stereodefined alkyne to alkene reduction.

3) Competing pathways in halohydrin formation: Treating 3-methyl-1-butene with Br2/H2O gives a major bromohydrin. Which statement best describes the regiochemistry and stereochemistry?  
A. OH at less substituted carbon; syn addition  
B. OH at more substituted carbon; anti addition  
C. Br at more substituted carbon; syn addition  
D. OH at less substituted carbon; anti addition  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Halohydrin formation proceeds via a halonium ion with water opening at the more substituted carbon, placing OH at that site and Br at the less substituted carbon. Nucleophilic opening of the cyclic halonium occurs anti to the leaving group, giving overall anti addition.

4) Directing group conflict: Nitration of p-methyl anisole (p-methyl methoxybenzene) is attempted. What mixed directive effect is expected, and which positions are predominantly nitrated?  
A. Meta only, because methyl overrides methoxy  
B. Ortho/para activation, with nitration mainly at positions ortho to methoxy and methyl  
C. Deactivation and meta to methoxy due to competition  
D. Benzyne pathway dominates to give random substitution  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Both methoxy and methyl are ring-activating ortho/para directors, so nitration occurs at positions ortho to either substituent and para to the other if available; methoxy is more strongly activating, so positions ortho to OMe often dominate under standard EAS nitration conditions.

5) Selective alcohol oxidation: A molecule contains a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol. The goal is to oxidize only the primary alcohol to an aldehyde. Which single-reagent choice is best?  
A. Jones reagent (H2CrO4, aq)  
B. PCC in dichloromethane  
C. KMnO4, hot, aqueous  
D. O3, Me2S  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: PCC in a non-aqueous solvent oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes without overoxidation and also cleanly oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones; however, to oxidize only the primary site, the secondary alcohol can be protected (if needed) or conditions tuned. Among single reagents, PCC is the most suitable for aldehyde-level oxidation without water-promoted overoxidation, unlike Jones or KMnO4 which readily give carboxylic acids; ozonolysis targets alkenes, not alcohols.

6) 1,2 vs 1,4 selectivity: Reaction of a cuprate R2CuLi with cyclohexenone under standard conditions typically gives which major outcome, compared with RMgX?  
A. Cuprate gives 1,2-addition; Grignard gives 1,4-addition  
B. Both give predominant 1,2-addition  
C. Cuprate gives 1,4-conjugate addition; Grignard gives predominant 1,2-addition  
D. Both give predominant 1,4-addition  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Organocuprates are classic for conjugate (1,4) addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls; Grignard reagents, being harder and more basic, favor direct 1,2-addition to the carbonyl under typical conditions. Reagent choice controls regiochemical outcome in enone additions.

7) Carbonyl umpolung planning: Convert benzaldehyde to 2-phenylethanol via a two-step sequence employing a cyanide-based synthon. Which sequence is most consistent?  
A. Benzaldehyde + HCN → cyanohydrin; LiAlH4 reduction → 2-phenylethanol  
B. Benzaldehyde + HCN → cyanohydrin; DIBAL-H partial reduction → aldehyde shift  
C. Benzaldehyde + RMgX → secondary alcohol; PCC oxidation → 2-phenylethanol  
D. Benzaldehyde + NH2OH → oxime; Wolff–Kishner → 2-phenylethanol  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Cyanide serves as a formyl anion equivalent; cyanohydrin formation introduces a −CH2−N functionality after reduction. Reducing the cyano group and the alkoxide gives the primary alcohol side-chain homologue, 2-phenylethanol, consistent with formyl/anionic umpolung strategy described for CN-based equivalents.

8) Choosing substitution vs elimination: 2-bromo-2-methylbutane is treated with methoxide in methanol at reflux. Which major pathway and product distribution is expected?  
A. SN2 to give 2-methoxy-2-methylbutane predominantly  
B. SN1 to give racemic substitution product only  
C. E1/E2 to give mainly 2-methyl-2-butene (Zaitsev) with minor 2-methyl-1-butene  
D. SNAr at benzylic position to give rearranged ether  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: A tertiary bromide with a strong base/nucleophile and heat promotes elimination; Zaitsev product (more substituted alkene) predominates with some less substituted alkene. SN2 is disfavored at tertiary centers; SNAr is irrelevant for aliphatic substrates.

9) Controlled ester formation: To prepare ethyl benzoate from benzoic acid and ethanol efficiently, which statement best ensures higher yield in Fischer esterification?  
A. Use aqueous acid to drive equilibrium toward ester  
B. Remove water continuously or use excess ethanol as solvent  
C. Add strong base to neutralize acid catalyst  
D. Use dilute ethanol to prevent acetal formation  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Fischer esterification is an equilibrium process; Le Châtelier’s principle applies. Removing water during the reaction or using ethanol as both reagent and solvent drives the equilibrium toward ester formation. Base would quench the acid catalyst needed; aqueous media disfavor ester formation.

10) Protection logic in multi-step synthesis: A substrate contains a ketone and a primary alcohol. A Grignard addition to the ketone is planned without reacting at the alcohol. Which approach is most appropriate?  
A. Convert the alcohol to a silyl ether (e.g., TBS) before forming RMgX and performing the addition  
B. Oxidize the alcohol to aldehyde, then proceed; no protection needed  
C. Convert the ketone to an acetal; leave alcohol free; then attempt Grignard on the acetal  
D. Use aqueous conditions to suppress Grignard reactivity  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Grignard reagents are quenched by protic OH groups; protecting the alcohol as a silyl ether (TBS/TBDPS) preserves it during RMgX formation and ketone addition. Protecting group strategies and functional group compatibility with organometallics are emphasized for selective synthesis planning.

Notes on difficulty and scope  
- These problems require correlating mechanism with selectivity, reagent choice, and equilibrium/kinetic control, consistent with the “Understand and Apply” level for intermediate questions. They integrate multiple sections: alkenes/alkynes, aromatics, alcohol/phenol oxidation and protection, carbonyl additions/umpolung, acyl derivatives, substitution–elimination competition, organometallic selectivity, and synthesis planning.
