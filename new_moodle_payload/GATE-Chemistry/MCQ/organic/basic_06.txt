**Part 1: Basic Level MCQs**

1) Retrosynthetic analysis involves working **backward** from the target molecule to simpler starting materials. The symbol used to represent a retrosynthetic step is:

A. A forward arrow (→)  
B. A double-headed equilibrium arrow (⇌)  
C. A retrosynthetic arrow (⇒)  
D. A curved arrow mechanism  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Retrosynthetic analysis uses a special retrosynthetic arrow (⇒) to indicate backward thinking from product to precursor, distinguishing it from forward synthesis arrows. A forward arrow denotes actual chemical transformation in the synthetic direction. Equilibrium arrows represent reversible processes, not retrosynthetic planning. Curved arrows show electron flow in mechanisms, not strategic disconnections.

2) In retrosynthetic planning, FGA stands for Functional Group Analysis. The primary purpose of FGA is to:

A. Calculate the molecular weight of functional groups  
B. Identify key reactive sites for strategic disconnection  
C. Determine spectroscopic properties of the target  
D. Measure the toxicity of functional groups  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Functional Group Analysis systematically identifies reactive functional groups in the target molecule to guide disconnection strategy and determine which bonds should be broken retrosynthetically. Molecular weight calculation is not relevant to retrosynthetic strategy. Spectroscopic properties help in structure determination, not synthesis planning. Toxicity assessment relates to safety, not disconnection logic.

3) A synthon is best described as a:

A. Real chemical reagent available commercially  
B. Hypothetical reactive fragment with defined charge distribution  
C. Protecting group used in multi-step synthesis  
D. Catalyst that accelerates C-C bond formation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Synthons are idealized, charged fragments generated during retrosynthetic disconnection that represent the reactive species conceptually; they guide the selection of actual reagents. Real reagents are called synthetic equivalents, not synthons. Protecting groups mask functional groups temporarily but are not disconnection fragments. Catalysts facilitate reactions but do not represent disconnection fragments.

4) The synthetic equivalent of a carbanion synthon \(\mathrm{R^-}\) in C-C bond formation is most commonly:

A. An alkyl halide (RX)  
B. A Grignard reagent (RMgX)  
C. An aldehyde (RCHO)  
D. An ester (RCOOR')  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Grignard reagents (RMgX) act as carbanion equivalents, providing nucleophilic carbon for C-C bond formation by attacking electrophiles like carbonyls. Alkyl halides are electrophiles, not nucleophilic carbanion equivalents. Aldehydes are electrophilic carbonyl compounds, not carbanion sources. Esters are also electrophilic and do not act as carbanion equivalents.

***

5) Functional Group Interconversion (FGI) in retrosynthetic analysis refers to:

A. Changing one functional group to another to facilitate disconnection  
B. Removing all functional groups from the molecule  
C. Converting the target molecule to its mirror image  
D. Measuring the reactivity of functional groups spectroscopically  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: FGI involves converting one functional group to another in the retrosynthetic direction to enable simpler or more efficient disconnections in earlier steps. Complete removal of functional groups is not the goal of strategic synthesis planning. Conversion to mirror images relates to stereochemistry, not FGI. Spectroscopic measurement is an analytical technique, not a retrosynthetic strategy.

***

6) In the Wittig reaction used for olefin synthesis, the nucleophilic synthon is represented by:

A. A phosphonium ylide  
B. An aldehyde or ketone  
C. An alkyl halide  
D. A Grignard reagent  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The Wittig reaction employs a phosphonium ylide as the nucleophilic carbon synthon that attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon to form a C=C bond. Aldehydes or ketones serve as electrophiles in the Wittig reaction, not nucleophiles. Alkyl halides are precursors to ylides but are not the nucleophilic synthon themselves. Grignard reagents are used in different C-C bond formations, not the Wittig reaction.

***

7) Umpolung reactivity refers to:

A. Increasing the polarity of a molecule  
B. Reversing the natural polarity of a functional group  
C. Removing all polar groups from a molecule  
D. Converting nonpolar molecules to polar ones  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Umpolung (German for "polarity reversal") involves inverting the normal charge distribution of functional groups, such as making carbonyl carbons nucleophilic instead of electrophilic. Simply increasing polarity does not describe polarity reversal. Complete removal of polar groups is not umpolung. Converting nonpolar to polar molecules does not involve reversing existing polarity.

***

8) Cyanide ion (CN⁻) serves as a formyl anion equivalent because upon nucleophilic addition to an electrophile followed by reduction, it can generate:

A. A carboxylic acid  
B. An aldehyde functional group  
C. A ketone  
D. An ester  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Cyanide adds as a nucleophile to form a nitrile, which upon partial reduction (e.g., with DIBAL-H) yields an aldehyde, functionally equivalent to adding a CHO⁻ (formyl anion) synthon. Carboxylic acids result from complete hydrolysis of nitriles, not formyl anion equivalency. Ketones are not the direct product of cyanide addition and reduction. Esters require additional transformations beyond formyl anion chemistry.

***

9) In multi-step synthesis, protecting groups are used to:

A. Increase the molecular weight of the product  
B. Temporarily block reactive sites to prevent unwanted reactions  
C. Speed up all reactions in the sequence  
D. Remove all functional groups permanently  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Protecting groups temporarily mask reactive functional groups during steps where they would otherwise interfere, and are removed later to regenerate the original functionality. Increasing molecular weight is not the purpose of protection. Protecting groups do not generally accelerate reactions. Permanent removal contradicts the temporary nature of protection strategy.

***

10) Atom economy is calculated as:

A. (Molecular weight of desired product / Sum of molecular weights of all reactants) × 100%  
B. (Number of atoms in product / Number of atoms in reactants) × 100%  
C. (Yield of reaction / Theoretical yield) × 100%  
D. (Mass of catalyst / Mass of product) × 100%  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Atom economy quantifies the efficiency of a reaction by comparing the molecular weight of the desired product to the total molecular weight of all reactants, reflecting how much starting material ends up in the product. Counting atoms directly is less practical than using molecular weights. Yield percentage measures actual vs. theoretical product obtained, not inherent reaction efficiency. Catalyst mass ratio does not define atom economy.
