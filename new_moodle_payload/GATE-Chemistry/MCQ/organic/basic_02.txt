Basic level MCQs for GATE Organic Chemistry (Reaction Mechanisms). Each question follows the requested format and targets the core and related concepts from the attached file, aligned to the specified learning objectives and milestones.

1) Under kinetic control, the major product is typically the one that:
A. Has the lowest free energy at equilibrium  
B. Forms through the pathway with the lowest activation energy  
C. Has the greatest resonance stabilization in the product  
D. Is favored only at high temperatures due to reversibility  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Kinetic control selects the product formed fastest, i.e., via the lowest activation barrier, regardless of its final thermodynamic stability. Thermodynamic control instead favors the lowest free-energy product at equilibrium, commonly accessed at higher temperature or reversible conditions. Options focusing on resonance or high-temperature favorability conflate thermodynamic control and do not define kinetic selection criteria.

2) Hammond’s postulate implies that for an endothermic step, the transition state:
A. Resembles the reactants more than the products  
B. Occurs earlier along the reaction coordinate  
C. Resembles the products more than the reactants  
D. Is unaffected by the reaction energetics  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: In an endothermic step, the transition state is “product-like,” reflecting Hammond’s postulate that TS structure mirrors the nearest energy well; exothermic steps have “reactant-like” TSs. Early vs. late transition state positioning correlates with endo/exothermicity; claiming no effect of energetics contradicts the postulate.

3) The Curtin–Hammett principle primarily applies when:
A. Two conformers interconvert slowly relative to reaction  
B. Two conformers interconvert rapidly and form different products via different TS energies  
C. Two products equilibrate rapidly after formation  
D. The more stable conformer always gives the major product  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: When conformers interconvert faster than reaction, product ratios are determined by the relative transition state energies leading from each conformer, not by conformer populations alone. Slow interconversion invalidates Curtin–Hammett, product equilibration is a thermodynamic scenario, and the more stable conformer need not yield the major product if its pathway has higher TS energy.

4) A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is most diagnostic when:
A. The labeled bond is not broken in the rate-limiting step  
B. The labeled bond is broken in the rate-limiting step  
C. The isotope is on a spectator group far from reaction center  
D. Only product ratios change without rate changes  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A primary KIE arises when the isotopically labeled bond is cleaved in the rate-determining step, altering zero-point energies and transition state vibrational modes to measurably change the rate. Labeling non-breaking or remote bonds leads to secondary or negligible KIEs; KIE concerns rate changes rather than only product distribution.

5) In the Hammett equation, a large positive reaction constant (ρ) suggests that the transition state:
A. Stabilizes with electron-donating substituents  
B. Is insensitive to substituent effects  
C. Is stabilized by electron-withdrawing substituents  
D. Involves negligible charge development  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: A large positive ρ means electron-withdrawing groups accelerate the reaction, indicating buildup of negative charge or loss of positive charge in the transition state; electron-donating groups would have the opposite effect (negative ρ). Insensitivity contradicts “large,” and negligible charge development would correspond to small |ρ| .

6) For an SN2 reaction of a secondary bromide, the expected stereochemical outcome at the reacting center is:
A. Racemization due to carbocation formation  
B. Retention due to internal return  
C. Inversion due to backside attack  
D. No change because of neighboring group participation  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: SN2 is concerted backside attack with inversion at the stereocenter. Racemization and internal return are associated with SN1 or SNi conditions; neighboring group participation can alter pathways but does not generally preserve configuration in a standard SN2 scenario.

7) In electrophilic aromatic substitution, a strongly deactivating group such as nitro (-NO2) directs new substitution:
A. Ortho and para due to resonance donation  
B. Meta due to strong electron withdrawal  
C. Ortho only due to steric hindrance  
D. Para only due to lower steric demand  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Strongly electron-withdrawing groups like nitro are meta directors; they destabilize the ortho/para sigma complexes via unfavorable resonance charge distribution. Ortho/para directing groups are typically electron donating; steric arguments alone cannot convert a deactivating group into ortho-only or para-only director.

8) Addition of HBr to propene under standard ionic conditions follows Markovnikov’s rule because:
A. Bromide adds first to the less substituted carbon via radical chain  
B. Protonation gives the more stable secondary carbocation intermediate  
C. A three-membered bromonium ion forms and opens syn  
D. The reaction is concerted with anti addition  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In ionic electrophilic addition of HX to alkenes, protonation occurs to form the more stable carbocation (secondary > primary), placing H on the less substituted carbon and Br on the more substituted one (Markovnikov). Bromonium ions characterize halogen additions; radical conditions give anti-Markovnikov in presence of peroxides.

9) Nucleophilic addition to an aldehyde is generally faster than to a ketone mainly because:
A. Aldehydes are less electrophilic  
B. Aldehydes are less sterically hindered and more electron-deficient  
C. Ketones cannot form tetrahedral intermediates  
D. Aldehydes stabilize carbanions better  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Aldehydes possess one alkyl substituent and a hydrogen, making them less hindered and typically more electrophilic than ketones with two alkyl groups, leading to faster formation of tetrahedral intermediates. Ketones do form tetrahedral intermediates; electrophilicity and sterics drive the observed trend.

10) In an E2 elimination of a β-haloalkane with a strong base, the stereochemical requirement is best described as:
A. Syn-coplanar orientation of β-H and leaving group  
B. Anti-periplanar orientation of β-H and leaving group  
C. Any conformation due to carbocation intermediates  
D. Planar carbocation formation followed by deprotonation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: E2 eliminations are concerted and typically require anti-periplanar alignment of the β-hydrogen and leaving group for optimal orbital overlap, leading to stereospecific outcomes. Syn-coplanar occurs in special constrained cases; options invoking carbocations describe E1, not E2.
