1) The correct order of stability for the following carbocations is:  
(i) tert-butyl, (ii) benzyl, (iii) allyl, (iv) ethyl  
A. ii > iii > i > iv  
B. i > ii > iii > iv  
C. ii > i > iii > iv  
D. iii > ii > i > iv  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Benzyl carbocations are highly stabilized by resonance over the aromatic ring; allyl carbocations are also resonance-stabilized but less than benzyl; tert-butyl benefits only from hyperconjugation; ethyl is the least stabilized primary cation. Thus ii (benzyl) > iii (allyl) > i (tert-butyl) > iv (ethyl). Treating hyperconjugation as stronger than benzylic resonance or ignoring resonance in allylic species leads to the incorrect orders in the other options.

2) A secondary carbocation undergoes a Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement more readily when one adjacent group is:  
A. A hydrogen and the other a methyl group  
B. A methyl and the other a phenyl group  
C. Two equivalent methyl groups  
D. Two fluorine substituents  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In a Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement, the migrating group is typically the one that leads to a more stabilized carbocation after migration; phenyl migration generates a benzylic-type cation, strongly stabilized by resonance. A hydrogen shift is less beneficial than aryl migration in this scenario; equivalent methyl groups give no driving force; two fluorines are strongly −I and do not create a more stable cation upon migration.

3) Which carbanion is expected to be most stable?  
A. CH3–CH2–CH2⁻  
B. Ph–CH2⁻ (benzyl)  
C. H2C=CH–CH2⁻ (allyl)  
D. HC≡C⁻ (ethynyl)  

Correct answer: D  

Explanation: Ethynyl anion is sp-hybridized, giving the lone pair highest s-character and greatest stabilization of negative charge. Benzyl and allyl anions are resonance-stabilized but with lower s-character at the charged center; a simple primary alkyl anion lacks both resonance and high s-character. Confusing radical/carbenium stabilization orders with anionic stability leads to choosing benzyl or allyl incorrectly.

4) A diazomethane-derived carbene is generated and reacts with cyclohexene. Which major transformation is expected?  
A. Formation of a vicinal dihalide  
B. Cyclopropanation of the double bond  
C. 1,2-hydride shift to give a rearranged alkane  
D. Electrophilic aromatic substitution  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Carbenes generated from diazo compounds add across C=C bonds to form cyclopropanes; this is a classic carbene–alkene transformation. Dihalide formation is associated with halogen addition; hydride shifts are carbocation-based rearrangements; electrophilic aromatic substitution involves aromatic π-systems, not an isolated cyclohexene double bond.

5) A singlet carbene adds to an alkene. Compared with a triplet carbene, the addition pathway is more likely to be:  
A. Stepwise with radical intermediates and racemic mixture  
B. Concerted and stereospecific, retaining alkene stereochemistry  
C. Radical-chain with initiation and propagation  
D. Non-stereoselective due to planar intermediates  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Singlet carbenes, with paired electrons, typically undergo concerted cyclopropanation, giving stereospecific products that reflect the original alkene geometry. Triplet carbenes often react stepwise via diradical pathways, which can reduce stereospecificity. Assuming all carbenes behave identically or all pathways are radical-chain leads to the wrong choices.

6) An aryne is generated from o-fluorotoluene with strong base. A nucleophile attacks the benzyne at either of the two triple-bond carbons. Which statement best describes the product distribution?  
A. Only substitution ortho to the methyl group is formed.  
B. Only substitution meta to the methyl group is formed.  
C. A mixture of isomeric products forms due to unsymmetrical aryne and directing effects of Me.  
D. No product forms because benzyne cannot be generated from aryl fluorides.  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: In unsymmetrical arynes, nucleophilic attack can occur at both triple-bond carbons, giving mixtures whose ratios depend on electronic and steric effects (here, the methyl group influences regiochemistry, but does not enforce exclusivity). Benzyne can be formed from aryl fluorides under appropriately strong base conditions; it does not give a single regioisomer only.

7) In a radical addition of HBr to propene under peroxide and light, which product predominates?  
A. CH3–CH2–CH2–Br  
B. CH3–CH(Br)–CH3  
C. CH3–CH(Br)–CH2–CH3  
D. CH2Br–CH2–CH3  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Radical HBr addition proceeds via anti-Markovnikov orientation: Br· adds first to the less substituted carbon of the double bond to form the more stable secondary radical, followed by H-atom transfer to give 1-bromopropane (CH3–CH2–CH2–Br). Markovnikov addition (2-bromopropane) arises from ionic conditions without peroxides; extending the chain or adding Br at the wrong carbon reflects misunderstanding of the chain mechanism.

8) In a pinacol rearrangement of a symmetrical vicinal diol, which step gives rise to skeletal rearrangement?  
A. Initial protonation of one hydroxyl group  
B. Dehydration to form a carbocation adjacent to the other OH  
C. Nucleophilic attack of water on the carbocation  
D. Final deprotonation of the carbonyl product  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The key step is loss of water from the protonated alcohol to generate a carbocation; subsequent 1,2-migration of an adjacent group (alkyl or aryl) occurs from the carbon bearing the remaining OH to the cationic center, leading to rearranged carbonyl. Protonation and final deprotonation are acid–base steps without skeletal change; nucleophilic water attack is typical of hydration, not the rearrangement pathway itself.

9) A substrate capable of forming both an allylic carbocation and a non-allylic tertiary carbocation is ionized. Under typical solvolysis conditions, which intermediate is usually preferred?  
A. Non-allylic tertiary carbocation only  
B. Allylic carbocation only  
C. Whichever carbocation is more stabilized by the combination of resonance and hyperconjugation  
D. Neither, because such substrates never ionize  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Carbocation formation favors the more stabilized intermediate, and stability reflects both resonance (as in allylic systems) and hyperconjugation (as in highly substituted centers). Thus whichever arrangement maximizes these effects will dominate. Assuming tertiary always wins (ignoring resonance) or that allylic always wins (ignoring substitution) oversimplifies the stability analysis.

10) Which feature helps distinguish a radical 1,2-shift from a cationic Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement in a multi-step synthesis problem?  
A. Presence of peroxides, light, or radical initiators vs. strong acid  
B. Exclusive formation of carbocations in both cases  
C. Requirement of diazo precursors in both cases  
D. Inability of radicals to undergo rearrangements  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Radical rearrangements typically occur in the presence of radical initiation conditions (peroxides, heat, or light) and involve neutral radicals, whereas Wagner–Meerwein rearrangements arise in strongly acidic, ionizing conditions through carbocations. Radicals can and do undergo rearrangements; diazo precursors are associated with carbene chemistry, not generic rearrangements.
