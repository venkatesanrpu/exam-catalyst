The following 10 basic-level MCQs are tailored to GATE Organic Chemistry, covering selectivity (chemo-, regio-, stereo-), protecting groups, and foundations of asymmetric synthesis as specified in organic_unit_07.txt.

1) Which statement best defines chemoselectivity in organic synthesis?
A. Preference for formation of one enantiomer over the other  
B. Preference for reaction at one functional group in the presence of others  
C. Preference for addition to one face of a planar electrophile  
D. Preference for substitution at the least hindered site within the same group  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Chemoselectivity refers to a reagent reacting with one functional group selectively when multiple functional groups are present in a molecule. This contrasts with enantioselectivity (one enantiomer favored) and regioselectivity (site preference within similar sites). Selecting reagents/conditions that differentiate functional groups exemplifies chemoselectivity. Options describing enantioselectivity or regioselectivity do not define this principle.

2) In electrophilic aromatic substitution, an electron-donating substituent such as –OCH3 typically directs incoming electrophiles to:
A. Meta position due to deactivation  
B. Ortho/para positions due to activation  
C. Only para position due to steric hindrance  
D. Only ortho position due to resonance donation  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Electron-donating groups activate the ring and stabilize sigma complexes at ortho and para positions via resonance, increasing substitution there. Exclusive para or ortho selection is not guaranteed at the basic level; both are favored depending on sterics and conditions. Meta-directing behavior is characteristic of strong electron-withdrawing groups, not –OCH3.

3) Which choice describes enantioselectivity most accurately?
A. Formation of one diastereomer preferentially in presence of an existing stereocenter  
B. Formation of one enantiomer preferentially from a prochiral substrate  
C. Formation of the kinetic product over the thermodynamic product  
D. Preferential reaction of aldehyde over ketone within the same molecule  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Enantioselectivity refers to the preferential formation of one enantiomer when a prochiral substrate reacts in a chiral environment (catalyst, auxiliary, enzyme). Diastereoselectivity pertains to preference among diastereomers when stereocenters influence outcomes. Kinetic vs thermodynamic control and aldehyde vs ketone reactivity are unrelated to enantioselectivity definitions.

4) A primary purpose of installing a protecting group during a multistep synthesis is to:
A. Increase molecular weight for easier purification  
B. Permanently deactivate all reactive sites  
C. Temporarily mask a functional group incompatible with planned steps  
D. Enhance the leaving group ability of the protected site permanently  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Protecting groups are temporary masks that prevent undesired reactions on sensitive functional groups, enabling selective transformations elsewhere. They must be removable under orthogonal conditions. They do not permanently deactivate or necessarily improve leaving group ability as a goal, and increased molecular weight is incidental, not the purpose.

5) Which alcohol protecting group is commonly chosen for acid-sensitive sequences due to base- or fluoride-labile deprotection?
A. Benzyl ether  
B. Silyl ether (e.g., TBS)  
C. Trityl ether (Tr)  
D. Acetal from a diol  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Trialkylsilyl ethers like TBS are stable to many acids and can be removed with fluoride (e.g., TBAF) or base, fitting orthogonal strategies where acid is used elsewhere. Benzyl ethers are typically removed by hydrogenolysis; trityl groups are acid-labile; acetals are acid-labile carbonyl protections, not primarily alcohol protections for acid-sensitive sequences.

6) Which statement best describes resolution of enantiomers by diastereomeric salt formation?
A. Converts a racemate directly into a single enantiomer without separation  
B. Produces diastereomeric salts with different physical properties for separation  
C. Requires a chiral catalyst to convert both enantiomers to the same product  
D. Relies on forming enantiomeric salts with identical solubilities  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Chemical resolution often forms diastereomeric salts by reacting a racemic acid or base with a single enantiomer of a resolving agent; the salts have different solubilities/melting points, enabling separation and subsequent recovery. It does not inherently convert both to a single enantiomer without separation, and it creates diastereomers, not enantiomeric salts of identical properties.

7) Desymmetrization is most directly defined as:
A. Separation of racemates into single enantiomers  
B. Converting a racemic mixture into a meso compound  
C. Selectively transforming a prochiral or meso substrate to generate chirality  
D. Converting enantiomers to diastereomers for separation  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Desymmetrization transforms a prochiral or meso compound such that symmetry is broken, creating a chiral center or axis, often using selective reagents or enzymes. Resolution is the separation of racemates via diastereomeric derivatives; converting to meso is the opposite of introducing chirality.

8) The Evans oxazolidinone is primarily used in synthesis as:
A. A permanent chiral auxiliary embedded in the final product  
B. A temporary chiral auxiliary to control diastereoselectivity in reactions like aldol  
C. A chiral phase-transfer catalyst for SN2 substitutions  
D. A hydrogen-bond donor organocatalyst for Diels–Alder reactions  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Evans oxazolidinone functions as a temporary chiral auxiliary attached to carboxylic acid derivatives to direct diastereoselective transformations (e.g., aldol), and is later removed and recovered. It is not a catalyst, not permanent, and is not a hydrogen-bond donor organocatalyst.

9) Proline in asymmetric organocatalysis typically operates via which activation mode?
A. Iminium/enamine activation enabling enantioselective aldol and Michael reactions  
B. Metal–ligand backbonding to lower LUMO of carbonyls  
C. Generation of free radicals via single-electron transfer  
D. Strong Brønsted acid activation of alkenes  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Proline and related secondary amines form enamines (nucleophile activation) or iminium ions (electrophile activation), enabling enantioselective aldol and Michael additions through chiral enamine/iminium pathways. Organocatalysis here does not involve metal backbonding, radical pathways, or strong acid activation of alkenes.

10) Which statement best captures the concept of double stereodifferentiation?
A. Only substrate control dictates stereochemical outcome  
B. Only reagent/catalyst control dictates stereochemical outcome  
C. Substrate and reagent/catalyst chirality act together, leading to matched or mismatched cases  
D. Stereochemical outcomes are independent of both substrate and reagent chirality  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Double stereodifferentiation arises when both substrate and reagent/catalyst possess stereochemical information; matched cases reinforce selectivity, while mismatched cases reduce or invert it. Exclusive dependence on substrate or reagent alone does not describe the phenomenon, and independence from both is incorrect.
