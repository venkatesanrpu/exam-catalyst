The following 10 intermediate-level MCQs are tailored to GATE Organic Chemistry, emphasizing calculation/correlation and direct application across chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity models, protecting groups, resolution, desymmetrization, chiral auxiliaries, and organocatalysis from organic_unit_07.txt.

1) A molecule bears an aldehyde and an ester. Which single reagent-condition set most directly gives the primary alcohol from the aldehyde with minimal ester reduction at low temperature?
A. LiAlH4, THF, 0–25 °C  
B. NaBH4, MeOH, 0–25 °C  
C. DIBAL-H, toluene, −78 °C, then MeOH quench  
D. LiBH4, THF, reflux  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: At −78 °C, DIBAL-H reduces aldehydes rapidly, while esters are reduced more slowly and often stop at the aldehyde after controlled quench; this enables chemoselective reduction of the aldehyde in the presence of an ester. LiAlH4 and LiBH4 are too reactive and reduce esters; NaBH4 is mild but may still reduce aldehydes while leaving esters mostly untouched, not delivering the desired selectivity profile as reliably as low-temperature DIBAL control.

2) In a substrate containing both an aldehyde and a ketone, which condition favors chemoselective nucleophilic addition at the aldehyde?
A. Use of a hindered Grignard reagent at reflux  
B. Use of a softer cuprate at −78 °C  
C. Use of a bulky, less basic hydride at −78 °C  
D. Use of a strong organolithium at −78 °C  

Correct answer: D

Explanation: Aldehydes are more electrophilic and less sterically hindered than ketones, so a strong, fast nucleophile at low temperature (e.g., RLi) will preferentially add to the aldehyde under kinetic control. Softer cuprates may favor conjugate additions and be less reactive to simple carbonyls; hindered Grignards at reflux can cause side reactions; “bulky, less basic hydride” is vague and may not ensure selectivity in C–C bond formation.

3) For EAS on a ring bearing both –OCH3 and –NO2, the predominant regioisomer with Br2/FeBr3 is expected at:
A. Meta to –OCH3 due to deactivation by –NO2  
B. Ortho/para to –OCH3 because it is strongly activating and outcompetes –NO2  
C. Meta to –NO2 because –NO2 is a meta director and dominates  
D. Ortho to –NO2 due to its strong –I effect  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: –OCH3 is a strong ortho/para director and activates the ring, while –NO2 is a strong meta director but deactivating; the activated sites ortho/para to –OCH3 are favored for electrophilic substitution, typically overriding the deactivated positions influenced by –NO2. Thus bromination occurs mainly ortho/para to –OCH3.

4) Addition of a nucleophile to an α-chiral aldehyde lacking coordinating heteroatoms usually follows:
A. Chelation-controlled model with synclinal approach  
B. Cram’s steric approach model favoring attack from the least hindered face  
C. Prelog’s rule mandating opposite facial selectivity to Cram  
D. Felkin–Anh model dominated exclusively by electronic effects with no steric input  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Absent coordinating substituents, classical Cram steric approach control often predicts major diastereomer via attack from the less hindered face at the carbonyl. Chelation control becomes important with α-alkoxy/amine substituents under Lewis acidic conditions; Felkin–Anh refines Cram by including electronic effects with electronegative α-substituents.

5) A meso-1,2-diol undergoes selective monoacylation by a lipase to give a single optically active monoester. This process exemplifies:
A. Classical resolution via diastereomeric salt formation  
B. Kinetic resolution limited to 50% theoretical maximum  
C. Desymmetrization generating chirality from a meso substrate  
D. Dynamic kinetic resolution requiring racemization catalyst  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: Selective transformation of one enantiotopic OH in a meso diol breaks symmetry to give a chiral product, i.e., desymmetrization. Classical salt resolution addresses racemates; simple kinetic resolution caps at 50% conversion to isolate one enantiomer; DKR needs in situ racemization of the unreacted enantiomer, which is not a meso case.

6) Choosing between Boc and Cbz for protecting a primary amine in a sequence that uses strong acid but prohibits hydrogenation, the better choice is:
A. Boc, because it is removed by TFA and avoids hydrogenolysis  
B. Cbz, because it is removed under basic conditions  
C. Boc, because it requires hydrogenolysis for removal  
D. Cbz, because it is acid-labile like tert-butyl esters  

Correct answer: A

Explanation: Boc is acid-labile and typically removed by TFA; it avoids hydrogenation. Cbz is removed by hydrogenolysis, which is prohibited by the sequence; it is not generally base-labile nor acid-labile like tert-butyl esters.

7) A racemic secondary alcohol is subjected to lipase-catalyzed acetate formation, giving 40% conversion and 96% ee in the acetate. The selectivity factor s is closest to:
A. 2  
B. 6  
C. 12  
D. 24  

Correct answer: C

Explanation: For kinetic resolution, s = ln[(1−c)(1−ee_s)]/ln[(1−c)(1+ee_s)] or using product ee and conversion relations; at c = 0.40 and product ee_p = 0.96, the calculated s is approximately in the 10–12 range; 12 is the closest of the options. Lower values underestimate the high enantiodiscrimination implied by 96% ee at only 40% conversion.

8) In an Evans auxiliary-controlled aldol using a Z-boron enolate, the dominant diastereomer arises from a Zimmerman–Traxler chair in which:
A. Both large groups occupy axial positions, giving anti product  
B. The chiral auxiliary biases approach to give syn aldol from Z enolate  
C. The enolate geometry is irrelevant to syn/anti outcome  
D. E enolates give syn aldol preferentially under boron mediation  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Under boron-mediated aldol conditions with Z-boron enolates, the chair-like Zimmerman–Traxler transition state typically delivers syn aldol products; the Evans auxiliary enforces facial selectivity, enhancing diastereocontrol. E enolates generally favor anti products in this model.

9) In a proline-catalyzed asymmetric aldol between acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde, the origin of enantioselectivity is best attributed to:
A. Iminium activation of the aldehyde by protonation alone  
B. Enamine formation from acetone and chiral enamine addition to the aldehyde  
C. Metal–ligand backbonding lowering the aldehyde LUMO  
D. Single-electron transfer to generate radical ions  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Proline forms a chiral enamine with the ketone donor; this enamine adds to the aldehyde (often H-bond activated), and the chiral environment dictates enantiofacial approach, giving enantioenriched aldol products. Iminium activation can be involved with α,β-unsaturated acceptors, but the core mode here is enamine catalysis.

10) For competing 1,2- vs. 1,4-addition of MeLi and Me2CuLi to cyclohexenone at −78 °C, the expected major products are:
A. MeLi: 1,4-addition; Me2CuLi: 1,2-addition  
B. MeLi: 1,2-addition; Me2CuLi: 1,4-addition  
C. Both give predominantly 1,2-addition under kinetic control  
D. Both give predominantly 1,4-addition due to conjugation  

Correct answer: B

Explanation: Hard, highly basic nucleophiles like MeLi favor direct 1,2-addition to the carbonyl, whereas softer cuprates like Me2CuLi favor conjugate (1,4) addition to enones at low temperature, illustrating reagent-controlled regioselectivity.
