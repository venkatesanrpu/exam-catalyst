Based on the organic_unit_01.txt file covering Stereochemistry for GATE Chemistry Examination, here are 10 basic-level MCQs:

***

1) A molecule is chiral if it:

A. Contains a carbon atom bonded to four different groups  
B. Lacks a plane of symmetry and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image  
C. Has an axis of rotation  
D. Contains only sp³-hybridized carbon atoms  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Chirality is fundamentally defined as the property of a molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, and this occurs when the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. While tetrahedral carbon atoms bonded to four different groups are common chiral centres, chirality is not restricted to carbon—other atoms like sulfur, phosphorus, or nitrogen can also be chiral centres. An axis of rotation (such as a \(C_2\) axis) does not necessarily make a molecule achiral. The presence of only sp³-hybridized carbons does not guarantee chirality; the molecule must lack symmetry elements like planes or centres of inversion.

***

2) In the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which group has the highest priority?

A. \(-\mathrm{CH_2OH}\)  
B. \(-\mathrm{CH_3}\)  
C. \(-\mathrm{Br}\)  
D. \(-\mathrm{H}\)  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: The CIP priority rules assign higher priority to atoms with higher atomic number directly attached to the stereogenic centre. Bromine has an atomic number of 35, which is higher than carbon (6) in \(-\mathrm{CH_2OH}\) and \(-\mathrm{CH_3}\), and hydrogen (1). Therefore, \(-\mathrm{Br}\) receives the highest priority. \(-\mathrm{CH_2OH}\) has higher priority than \(-\mathrm{CH_3}\) based on the second-tier comparison (oxygen vs. hydrogen). Hydrogen, with the lowest atomic number, has the lowest priority.

***

3) A compound with two chiral centres can have a maximum of how many stereoisomers?

A. 2  
B. 4  
C. 8  
D. 16  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The maximum number of stereoisomers for a compound with \(n\) chiral centres is given by \(2^n\). For two chiral centres, \(2^2 = 4\) stereoisomers are possible. These consist of two pairs of enantiomers or a mixture of diastereomers depending on the relative configuration of the stereocentres. If the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it may have fewer than 4 stereoisomers due to the formation of meso compounds. Eight or sixteen stereoisomers would require three or four chiral centres, respectively.

***

4) Which of the following molecules is achiral?

A. 2-Chlorobutane  
B. 2,3-Dichlorobutane (meso form)  
C. Lactic acid  
D. 2-Bromobutanoic acid  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A meso compound contains chiral centres but possesses an internal plane of symmetry that makes the molecule achiral overall. The meso form of 2,3-dichlorobutane has two chiral centres but is superimposable on its mirror image due to the plane of symmetry. 2-Chlorobutane, lactic acid, and 2-bromobutanoic acid all contain a single chiral centre and no plane of symmetry, making them chiral compounds. Meso compounds are a special class where chirality at individual centres is canceled out by molecular symmetry.

***

5) The R/S nomenclature is used to describe:

A. The optical rotation of a compound  
B. The absolute configuration at a stereogenic centre  
C. The relative stereochemistry between two stereocentres  
D. The conformational preference of a molecule  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The R/S nomenclature system, based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, assigns absolute configuration to each stereogenic centre independently of optical rotation. Optical rotation (dextrorotatory or levorotatory) is an experimental property that does not directly correlate with R or S configuration. Relative stereochemistry between multiple stereocentres is described using terms like erythro/threo or syn/anti, not R/S. Conformational preferences are analyzed using Newman projections or energy diagrams, not R/S descriptors.

***

6) Which projection is most commonly used to represent the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in open-chain compounds with multiple chiral centres?

A. Newman projection  
B. Fischer projection  
C. Haworth projection  
D. Chair conformation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Fischer projections are specifically designed for representing open-chain compounds with multiple chiral centres in a standardized vertical format where horizontal lines represent bonds coming out of the plane and vertical lines represent bonds going into the plane. Newman projections are used for conformational analysis along a single bond. Haworth projections depict cyclic sugars. Chair conformations are used for cyclohexane and similar ring systems. Fischer projections allow easy comparison of relative stereochemistry in polystereocentered molecules.

***

7) Enantiomers are stereoisomers that:

A. Differ in configuration at all stereocentres  
B. Are non-superimposable mirror images of each other  
C. Have different boiling points  
D. Rotate plane-polarized light in the same direction  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Enantiomers are defined as stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties such as boiling points, melting points, and solubility in achiral environments but differ in their interaction with plane-polarized light—one rotates it clockwise (dextrorotatory) and the other counterclockwise (levorotatory). Diastereomers differ in configuration at one or more (but not all) stereocentres and have different physical properties. The defining characteristic of enantiomers is the mirror-image relationship, not differences in configuration at all stereocentres.

***

8) Two hydrogen atoms on the same carbon are described as **enantiotopic** if:

A. Replacing either one with a different group produces enantiomers  
B. Replacing either one with a different group produces diastereomers  
C. They are chemically and magnetically equivalent in all environments  
D. They are on adjacent carbon atoms  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Enantiotopic atoms are those that, when separately replaced by a different group, generate enantiomers. This occurs when the two hydrogens are in a prochiral environment, such as on a carbon adjacent to a chiral centre or in an otherwise asymmetric molecule. If replacement produces diastereomers, the hydrogens are diastereotopic. Homotopic hydrogens are chemically and magnetically equivalent in all environments and yield identical products upon replacement. Enantiotopic relationships are determined by the molecule's symmetry, not by the position of atoms on adjacent carbons.

***

9) In conformational analysis of ethane, the staggered conformation is more stable than the eclipsed conformation because:

A. Staggered has lower torsional strain  
B. Staggered has stronger C-H bonds  
C. Eclipsed has higher bond dipole moments  
D. Eclipsed has stronger van der Waals attractions  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The staggered conformation of ethane is more stable because it minimizes torsional strain (also known as eclipsing strain), which arises from repulsion between electron clouds of adjacent C-H bonds when they are eclipsed. In the staggered form, the C-H bonds are maximally separated, reducing this repulsion. Bond strength is not affected by conformation. Dipole moments are not relevant in ethane as C-H bonds have minimal polarity. Van der Waals attractions are maximized when atoms are at optimal distances, not when bonds are eclipsed.

***

10) The term **(E)** in E/Z nomenclature indicates:

A. The higher-priority groups on each carbon of a double bond are on opposite sides  
B. The higher-priority groups on each carbon of a double bond are on the same side  
C. The molecule is chiral  
D. The double bond is in a ring system  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In the E/Z nomenclature system for alkene geometry, **(E)** (from German *entgegen*, meaning "opposite") indicates that the higher-priority substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. **(Z)** (from German *zusammen*, meaning "together") indicates they are on the same side. E/Z nomenclature applies to the geometric arrangement around double bonds and is unrelated to chirality or the presence of ring systems. This system uses Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to assign configurations unambiguously.
