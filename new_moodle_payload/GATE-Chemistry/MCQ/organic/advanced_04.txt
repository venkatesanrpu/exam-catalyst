Here are 5 advanced-level GATE Organic Chemistry MCQs (4-mark style) based on integrated multi-step synthesis, organometallics, umpolung, enolate chemistry, and route evaluation from the organic synthesis and multistep-synthesis units.

1) Target: 4-phenyl-2-butanone from benzene and an appropriate C2 unit, with constraints:  
- Avoid using acid chlorides due to corrosive waste.  
- Use at least one organometallic reagent and one carbonyl–based disconnection.  
Which retrosynthetic plan best satisfies these?  
A. Disconnection at C(=O)–CH2Ph to benzaldehyde + MeMgBr; benzaldehyde from benzene via chloromethylation and oxidation  
B. Disconnection at Ar–CH2–CH2–CO to benzyl bromide + acetoacetate; C-alkylation of ethyl acetoacetate followed by decarboxylation, then oxidation  
C. Disconnection at Ar–CO–CH2–CH3 to acetophenone + vinyl Grignard; hydrogenation of resulting allylic alcohol  
D. Disconnection at Ar–CH2–CH2–CO to benzene + propionyl chloride; Friedel–Crafts acylation then side-chain oxidation  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Advanced planning favors a robust carbonyl disconnection and avoids acid chlorides while incorporating organometallic chemistry. Disconnection to acetophenone plus a two-carbon organometallic equivalent of \(\ce{CH2=CH-}\) (e.g., vinylmagnesium halide) allows 1,2-addition to acetophenone, giving a tertiary allylic alcohol, followed by selective oxidative or rearrangement steps then hydrogenation to reach the methyl ketone side chain (4-phenyl-2-butanone). This uses a carbonyl disconnection, organometallic addition, and subsequent functional group interconversion consistent with multistep synthesis strategy. Other options either reintroduce acid chlorides (D), give wrong carbon skeletons or oxidation levels (A, B).

2) Consider the synthesis of a β-phenyl-β-hydroxy ester via an enantioselective aldol-type reaction starting from benzaldehyde and an achiral ester. The route must:  
- Use umpolung or masked acyl anion reactivity.  
- Provide high diastereo- and enantioselectivity.  
Which combination is most consistent?  
A. Direct base-catalyzed aldol between benzaldehyde and ethyl acetate, followed by kinetic resolution  
B. Use a thiazolium carbene (NHC) to generate a Breslow intermediate from benzaldehyde, followed by addition to an activated ester  
C. Form a chiral boron enolate from an Evans oxazolidinone amide of an acetic acid equivalent, then aldol with benzaldehyde, followed by auxiliary cleavage  
D. Generate a cyanohydrin from benzaldehyde, reduce to primary alcohol, then oxidize to the β-hydroxy ester  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Chiral auxiliary–based boron enolate aldol (Evans oxazolidinone) furnishes β-hydroxy carbonyl compounds with high syn/anti and facial selectivity using a controlled Zimmerman–Traxler-type transition state. The auxiliary amide is an acyl equivalent, and its boron enolate addition to benzaldehyde gives the β-phenyl-β-hydroxy amide; subsequent cleavage yields the β-hydroxy ester. This integrates enolate chemistry, chiral auxiliary control, and acyl-equivalent (masked acyl) reactivity. NHC umpolung of benzaldehyde in B is more suited to benzoin/Stetter chemistry than simple β-hydroxy ester formation. A lacks stereocontrol, and D gives a homologated alcohol but not the enolate-type aldol architecture.

3) A substrate contains:  
- An aldehyde, a terminal alkyne, and a phenolic OH on an aromatic ring.  
Goal: convert the alkyne to a conjugated (E)-styryl unit via cross-coupling, then reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol, while leaving phenol intact. Which protecting and coupling strategy best balances chemoselectivity and green-chemistry considerations?  
A. Protect phenol as benzyl ether; convert terminal alkyne to TMS-alkyne; perform Sonogashira coupling, then global hydrogenolysis to reveal phenol and reduce aldehyde  
B. Protect aldehyde as an acetal; leave phenol free; perform Suzuki coupling from a vinyl boronate made by hydroboration of the alkyne; then reduce aldehyde after deprotection  
C. Protect phenol as a silyl ether (TBS); perform Sonogashira coupling of the free terminal alkyne with an aryl bromide; reduce aldehyde with NaBH4; then remove TBS  
D. Protect phenol as methyl ether; oxidize aldehyde to acid; perform Heck coupling on the resulting vinyl acid; then reduce acid to alcohol  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Sonogashira coupling uses a terminal alkyne and aryl/vinyl halide to form aryl–alkyne bonds efficiently under Pd/Cu catalysis and is compatible with silyl ether–protected phenols. Protecting phenol as TBS ensures stability under basic coupling conditions and is removable under mild fluoride or acid. Aldehyde reduction with NaBH4 is compatible with silyl ethers and alkynes, aligning chemoselectivity with step economy and avoiding extensive hydrogenolysis or additional protecting groups, consistent with orthogonal protection and route optimization principles. Option A uses benzyl protection and global hydrogenolysis, which would over-reduce sensitive unsaturated motifs; B changes the coupling manifold to Suzuki from vinyl boronate but hydroboration destroys the terminal alkyne needed for cross-coupling. D misuses Heck on a carboxylic acid derivative and adds unnecessary oxidation–reduction cycles.

4) For a target containing both a conjugated enone and an isolated secondary alcohol, two synthetic routes are considered from the same diketone precursor:  

Route 1:  
(i) Global reduction of both carbonyls to diol (NaBH4),  
(ii) Selective oxidation of one secondary alcohol to enone using Swern,  
(iii) Protection/deprotection steps as needed.  

Route 2:  
(i) Chemoselective enolate formation and aldol-type condensation/dehydration to form the enone directly,  
(ii) Subsequent selective reduction of the remaining carbonyl to secondary alcohol using NaBH4.  

Which comparative statement is most accurate regarding atom economy and step-count efficiency?  
A. Route 1 is superior in atom economy because reductions and oxidations recycle reagents catalytically.  
B. Route 1 has higher step economy but lower atom economy than Route 2.  
C. Route 2 generally offers better atom economy and fewer redox-waste steps than Route 1.  
D. Both routes have similar atom economy since Swern byproducts are volatile and negligible.  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Atom economy measures how much of the reactant mass appears in the product; redox steps that generate stoichiometric byproducts (e.g., Swern’s DMS, CO, CO2, salts) lower atom economy. Route 1 performs global reduction then reoxidation, adding unnecessary redox cycles and waste, and likely more steps including selective protection. Route 2 constructs the enone directly via enolate chemistry (aldol/dehydration) and then performs a single reduction, minimizing redox toggling and waste, thereby improving both atom economy and step-count efficiency, in line with green-chemistry route design.

5) A conjugated enone with an α-chiral center adjacent to carbonyl must undergo nucleophilic addition of a cuprate to the β-position with maximal diastereoselectivity. The α-carbon bears an electronegative substituent (e.g., OR), and chelating conditions are deliberately avoided. Which stereochemical prediction model and reagent combination is most appropriate?  
A. Use Crams rule with a Grignard reagent under aprotic conditions  
B. Use Felkin–Anh model with a soft cuprate nucleophile in conjugate addition  
C. Use Prelog’s rule with hydride reduction under chelating Lewis acid conditions  
D. Use Zimmerman–Traxler model via a boron enolate and aldehyde electrophile  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For nucleophilic attack at a chiral α-carbon bearing an electronegative substituent, without chelation, the Felkin–Anh model refines Cram’s steric approach by incorporating the C–X bond’s electronic effects and gauche/antiperiplanar preferences. Conjugate (1,4) addition of a soft cuprate to an enone engages this model at the β-position, with facial selectivity governed by the α-chiral center and the C–X bond dipole; avoiding chelation ensures Felkin–Anh, not chelation control, dominates. Cram alone neglects strong electronic effects; Prelog is specialized for certain amino-acid-like systems; Zimmerman–Traxler applies to closed six-membered aldol transition states, not enone conjugate additions.
