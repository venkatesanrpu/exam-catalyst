1) In the context of carbonyl chemistry, an enolate is best described as:

A. A neutral tautomeric form of a ketone formed by protonation at oxygen  
B. An anionic species formed by deprotonation at the α‑carbon of a carbonyl compound  
C. A cationic intermediate formed by protonation of the carbonyl oxygen  
D. A radical species generated at the β‑carbon of an enone  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: An enolate is generated when a base removes an α‑hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl, giving an anion delocalized between carbon and oxygen.  The resonance-stabilized anion is not neutral (so the neutral tautomer in the first option actually refers to the enol, not the enolate), nor is it cationic or radical in nature, so the other descriptions are incorrect.

2) Under kinetic control, enolate formation from an unsymmetrical ketone preferentially gives:

A. The more substituted, thermodynamically more stable enolate  
B. The less substituted enolate formed by deprotonation at the less hindered α‑position  
C. Only the enolate stabilized by conjugation with an aromatic ring  
D. A 1:1 mixture of all possible enolates independent of conditions  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Kinetic enolates form faster at the less hindered α‑position using a strong, bulky base at low temperature, leading to the less substituted enolate.  Thermodynamic control instead favors the more substituted, more stable enolate, while the other options ignore the role of steric hindrance and reaction conditions, so they do not describe kinetic control correctly.

3) Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is typically employed in enolate chemistry because it:

A. Acts as a weak base giving thermodynamic enolates at high temperature  
B. Functions primarily as a nucleophile adding to carbonyls  
C. Is a strong, sterically hindered base that favors kinetic enolate formation  
D. Generates radicals at the α‑position of carbonyl compounds  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: LDA is a non‑nucleophilic, strongly basic, sterically bulky amide that rapidly deprotonates the least hindered α‑position, favoring kinetic enolate formation at low temperature.  It is not weak, not mainly nucleophilic toward carbonyls, and does not initiate radical pathways in this context, so the other descriptions are inconsistent with its typical role.

4) Enolates are often described as ambident nucleophiles because they can:

A. React only at oxygen with electrophiles  
B. React at either the α‑carbon or the oxygen atom with electrophiles  
C. React exclusively through a radical mechanism at the β‑carbon  
D. Act only as bases and never as nucleophiles  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Enolates possess nucleophilic character at both the α‑carbon and the oxygen due to resonance, enabling C‑ or O‑alkylation and other ambident reactions.  Limiting reactivity to oxygen alone, invoking β‑radicals, or denying nucleophilicity contradicts the well‑established ambident nature of enolates.

5) In a simple aldol reaction between an enolate and an aldehyde, the newly formed bond is:

A. A C–C bond between the enolate α‑carbon and the aldehyde carbonyl carbon  
B. A C–O bond between the enolate oxygen and the aldehyde carbonyl oxygen  
C. An O–O bond between two enolate oxygens  
D. A C–C bond between two aldehyde carbonyl carbons  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The aldol reaction forms a carbon–carbon bond when the nucleophilic α‑carbon of the enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde, generating a β‑hydroxy carbonyl product.  The other options misidentify the reacting centers, since neither O–O bonds nor direct coupling of two aldehyde carbonyl carbons is characteristic of a standard aldol step.

6) An enamine is most accurately described as:

A. A neutral nucleophile formed by condensation of a secondary amine with a carbonyl compound  
B. A negatively charged amide anion formed from a primary amine  
C. A cationic iminium species formed under strong acid conditions  
D. A radical intermediate formed by oxidation of an amine  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Enamines arise when secondary amines condense with aldehydes or ketones to give a C=C–N motif that is neutral yet nucleophilic at the α‑carbon.  Amide anions and iminium ions represent different charged species, and radical intermediates do not describe the typical structure or reactivity of enamines.

7) In the Stork enamine synthesis, the key role of the enamine is to:

A. Act as an electrophile toward nucleophiles  
B. Serve as a nucleophilic equivalent of an enolate for alkylation or acylation  
C. Protect the carbonyl from any reaction  
D. Generate radicals for chain reactions  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In Stork chemistry, the enamine behaves as a neutral enolate equivalent, undergoing alkylation or acylation at the α‑carbon and then hydrolysis to regenerate the carbonyl with a new substituent.  The enamine is not primarily electrophilic, does not simply protect the carbonyl without reaction, and is not used as a radical precursor in this context.

8) Silyl enol ethers are commonly used in synthesis because they:

A. Are less stable than enolates and therefore react immediately  
B. Serve as protected enolate equivalents that can be stored and later activated  
C. Cannot participate in carbon–carbon bond‑forming reactions  
D. Are purely protecting groups for alcohols and not related to enol chemistry  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Silyl enol ethers are formed by silylation of enolates or carbonyls, giving stable, neutral species that act as protected enolates and can be activated by Lewis acids for reactions such as Mukaiyama aldol.  They are more stable than enolates rather than less, they do participate in C–C bond formation, and they are distinct from typical alcohol protecting groups, so the other statements are inaccurate.

9) In Cram’s rule for nucleophilic addition to an α‑chiral carbonyl, the major product arises from nucleophile attack:

A. From the most sterically hindered face of the carbonyl  
B. From the less hindered face of the carbonyl, avoiding the largest substituent at the α‑carbon  
C. Equally from both faces, giving a racemic mixture  
D. Only after rotation to place the largest group syn to the incoming nucleophile  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Cram’s rule states that nucleophiles approach an α‑chiral carbonyl from the less hindered side in a conformation where the largest α‑substituent is oriented away, minimizing steric clash and governing diastereoselectivity.  Approaching from the most hindered face or enforcing syn orientation to the largest group contradicts the steric approach control at the heart of the rule, while a completely nonselective racemic outcome is not what Cram’s rule predicts.

10) The Felkin–Anh model refines Cram’s rule primarily by:

A. Ignoring steric effects and using only electronic effects  
B. Emphasizing the influence of electronegative α‑substituents and bond dipoles on the preferred approach of the nucleophile  
C. Applying only to substrates without heteroatoms  
D. Predicting that nucleophiles always attack perpendicular to the carbonyl plane  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The Felkin–Anh model incorporates both steric and electronic factors, particularly the orientation of C–X bonds (X = electronegative atoms) and their dipoles, to refine predictions of nucleophilic approach to chiral carbonyls.  It does not ignore sterics, is especially useful for heteroatom‑substituted substrates rather than excluding them, and does not rely on a simplistic perpendicular‑attack rule, so the other statements misrepresent the model.
