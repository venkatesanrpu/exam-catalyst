1) Two conformers \(A\) and \(B\) interconvert rapidly (\(A \rightleftharpoons B\)). \(A\) is 2.0 kcal/mol more stable than \(B\). Product \(P_1\) forms only from \(A\) with \(\Delta G^\ddagger_A = 25.0\) kcal/mol, while \(P_2\) forms only from \(B\) with \(\Delta G^\ddagger_B = 23.0\) kcal/mol. Under Curtin–Hammett conditions, the major product is:
A. \(P_1\), because \(A\) is more stable and therefore more populated  
B. \(P_2\), because product ratio is governed mainly by the lower transition-state barrier  
C. A 1:1 mixture, because rapid interconversion forces equal product formation  
D. Cannot be predicted without knowing the equilibrium constant \(K_{A/B}\)  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Under Curtin–Hammett conditions (rapid pre-equilibrium), the product ratio depends on the difference in activation free energies to products, not on conformer populations alone. Even though \(B\) is less populated, its pathway has a 2 kcal/mol lower \(\Delta G^\ddagger\), so it can dominate product formation by being much more reactive. The need for explicit \(K_{A/B}\) is bypassed because Curtin–Hammett emphasizes transition-state control when interconversion is fast relative to reaction.

2) A reaction series gives a linear Hammett plot with \(\rho = -4.0\) (using para substituents). The best mechanistic inference is that the rate-determining step involves:
A. Substantial buildup of negative charge in the transition state  
B. Substantial buildup of positive charge in the transition state  
C. No significant charge development; steric effects dominate  
D. A change in mechanism from SN1 to SN2 across the substituent series  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A large negative \(\rho\) indicates that electron-donating substituents accelerate the reaction strongly, consistent with a transition state that is stabilized by donation—typically one with increased positive charge (or decreased negative charge) at/near the reaction center. A large positive \(\rho\) would instead suggest negative-charge development or increased electron demand. A clean linear plot argues against a mechanism change across the series in this context.

3) An aromatic chloride undergoes nucleophilic substitution with \(\mathrm{NH_2^-}\) in liquid ammonia only under very strong basic conditions, and the product mixture shows substitution at two adjacent positions (regioisomeric mixture) rather than a single ipso-substitution product. This observation most strongly supports:
A. SNAr addition–elimination via a Meisenheimer complex  
B. Benzyne (elimination–addition) mechanism  
C. Electrophilic aromatic substitution via arenium ion  
D. Radical aromatic substitution via chain propagation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A requirement for very strong base and the formation of regioisomeric products are classic indicators of a benzyne elimination–addition pathway, where nucleophile addition to the aryne can occur at either end of the triple-bond-like intermediate. SNAr (Meisenheimer) is favored by strong electron-withdrawing groups ortho/para to the leaving group and typically gives ipso substitution with more predictable regiochemistry. Arenium ions describe electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic displacement.

4) A base-promoted elimination from a substrate bearing a strong electron-withdrawing group at the β-position shows a large primary β-deuterium kinetic isotope effect (rate decreases significantly when β-H is replaced by β-D). The most consistent mechanistic conclusion is:
A. E1 mechanism with carbocation formation as rate-determining step  
B. E2 mechanism with C–H bond cleavage involved in the rate-determining step  
C. E1cb mechanism where leaving-group departure occurs before deprotonation  
D. SN1 mechanism competing with elimination  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: A large primary β-deuterium KIE indicates that breaking the C–H (or C–D) bond is involved in the rate-determining step. That aligns with E2, where proton abstraction and leaving-group departure are concerted and C–H cleavage contributes directly to the transition state. In a common E1cb scenario, deprotonation can be fast pre-equilibrium and leaving-group departure may be rate-determining, which would reduce or remove a strong primary β-KIE; E1 rate-determination is ionization rather than β-C–H cleavage.

5) Two competing pathways lead from the same reactant to products \(X\) and \(Y\). Pathway to \(X\) is exothermic, pathway to \(Y\) is endothermic, and both proceed through carbocation-like transition states. Using Hammond’s postulate, the transition state leading to \(Y\) is expected to be:
A. More reactant-like, with little carbocation character  
B. More product-like, with greater carbocation character  
C. Identical to the transition state leading to \(X\)  
D. Unrelated to energetics; Hammond’s postulate does not apply to carbocations  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For an endothermic step, Hammond’s postulate predicts a late (product-like) transition state; if the product is carbocation-like (or has greater positive-charge character), the TS will display more of that character. For an exothermic step, the transition state is earlier and more reactant-like, typically showing less developed carbocation character. Hammond’s postulate is specifically useful for reasoning about carbocation and carbanion transition states, not excluded from them.
