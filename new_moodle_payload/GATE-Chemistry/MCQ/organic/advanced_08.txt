1) A chemist needs to install an α‑branch on an unsymmetrical ketone with precise regiocontrol and then perform a stereoselective aldol reaction with an aldehyde. Which sequence best combines kinetic/thermodynamic control and boron enolate chemistry to achieve both regio- and stereocontrol?

A. Use NaOEt/EtOH at reflux to form the thermodynamic enolate, trap as a silyl enol ether, then perform a base‑catalyzed aldol with an aldehyde  
B. Use LDA at low temperature to generate the kinetic enolate and alkylate; then convert the product to a Z‑boron enolate (Bu₂BOTf/base) and react with an aldehyde under Zimmerman–Traxler control  
C. Use NaH at high temperature to form the thermodynamic enolate, then perform a radical addition followed by dehydration  
D. Use a secondary amine to form an enamine, perform a Michael addition, and finally oxidize to regenerate the ketone before aldol  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: LDA at low temperature affords the kinetic enolate, enabling regioselective α‑alkylation at the less hindered position in the unsymmetrical ketone.  The resulting ketone can then be enolized with dibutylboron triflate/base to give a Z‑boron enolate that undergoes a chelation‑controlled, Zimmerman–Traxler chair transition state aldol, providing high syn diastereoselectivity.  Sodium ethoxide at reflux (first option) gives less predictable regiocontrol; NaH plus radical addition (third option) does not use boron‑mediated aldol control; the enamine/Michael/oxidation route (fourth option) alters the overall strategy and does not directly integrate boron enolate stereocontrol.

2) An α‑alkoxy aldehyde is treated with a Grignard reagent under two different conditions: (i) no additional Lewis acid; (ii) in the presence of Mg²⁺ or another chelating Lewis acid. How do Cram’s rule, chelation control, and the Felkin–Anh model together rationalize the change in diastereoselectivity observed between (i) and (ii)?

A. In both (i) and (ii), Felkin–Anh always dominates, so no change is expected  
B. In (i) Felkin–Anh/Cram steric control operates with the α‑OR group non‑chelating, but in (ii) chelation between metal and carbonyl/OR locks a different conformation, reversing the preferred attack face  
C. In (i) Cram chelation control dominates, whereas in (ii) chelation is completely suppressed, giving random attack  
D. In (i) only Prelog’s rule applies, while in (ii) only HSAB theory applies  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Without an added Lewis acid, the α‑alkoxy group is less strongly chelating, so stereochemical outcome often follows a Felkin–Anh or simple Cram steric model, where the nucleophile approaches opposite the smallest group with minimal steric and dipole interactions.  In the presence of a chelating metal, the carbonyl oxygen and α‑OR group bind the metal, enforcing a distinct chelation‑controlled conformation that can alter which face is less hindered, thus switching the major diastereomer relative to the non‑chelating case.  The idea that Felkin–Anh alone always dominates, that Cram chelation control operates without metal, or that only Prelog/HSAB explain the outcome ignores the crucial role of metal‑induced chelation vs. non‑chelation regimes.

3) A chiral amino acid–derived aldehyde undergoes reduction with a chiral hydride reagent. Experimentally, a “matched” combination gives very high diastereoselectivity, whereas a “mismatched” pair is much less selective. Which integrated stereochemical rationale best explains this observation?

A. Prelog’s rule and the chiral reagent’s intrinsic preference both direct hydride delivery to the same face in the matched case, while they compete in the mismatched case, reducing selectivity  
B. Cram’s rule predicts the same product in all cases, so the difference must be due only to solvent effects  
C. The chiral reagent controls stereochemistry exclusively, so substrate configuration is irrelevant  
D. The amino acid chirality is destroyed before reduction, so any selectivity must arise from racemization  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Prelog’s rule extends Cram’s approach to amino acid–type substrates, defining a preferred face of attack based on priority assignment (C–C > C–N > C–O > C–H) at the α‑carbon.  When the chiral hydride reagent’s own facial preference coincides with the substrate’s Prelog/Felkin bias (matched), both controls reinforce the same trajectory, giving high diastereoselectivity; in the mismatched case, the chiral influences oppose each other, partially canceling and lowering selectivity.  Attributing everything to solvent, ignoring substrate stereochemistry, or invoking complete racemization contradicts the documented matched/mismatched concept in chiral substrate–reagent combinations.

4) Consider a planned cascade sequence: an enolate formed from a β‑dicarbonyl compound undergoes intramolecular Michael addition onto a tethered enone, followed by an intramolecular aldol cyclization and dehydration to furnish a polycyclic enone. Which conceptual combination best describes the design logic?

A. Umpolung of the β‑dicarbonyl with a silyl enol ether, followed only by radical cyclization  
B. Sequential enolate‑type 1,4‑addition (Michael) and aldol condensation governed by enolate geometry and Zimmerman–Traxler transition states  
C. Only pericyclic reactions (electrocyclizations) are involved, so enolate chemistry is irrelevant  
D. A Cannizzaro reaction followed by a Claisen condensation  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The sequence uses enolate nucleophilicity in a conjugate Michael addition to a tethered enone, then a new enolate engages in an intramolecular aldol condensation, each step forming C–C bonds and building rings in a cascade fashion.  The stereochemistry of the aldol step can be rationalized by enolate E/Z geometry and Zimmerman–Traxler chair transition states, a key part of advanced aldol design.  Radical cyclization, pericyclic electrocyclizations, or Cannizzaro/Claisen processes do not match the described 1,4‑addition plus aldol–dehydration pathway.

5) A synthetic route to a densely functionalized chiral alcohol uses the following steps: (1) generation of a kinetic enolate and alkylation; (2) conversion of the resulting carbonyl compound into an enamine and conjugate addition to an enone; (3) formation of a silyl enol ether from the new ketone and Mukaiyama aldol with an aldehyde under Lewis acid catalysis. Which statement best captures the strategic integration of reactivity and stereocontrol in this sequence?

A. Each step randomly chooses a different nucleophile without any predictive control over regiochemistry or stereochemistry  
B. The route systematically uses enolate (anionic), enamine (neutral), and silyl enol ether (protected) nucleophiles to match conditions and functional‑group tolerance, while aldol and Michael steps are planned with Cram/Felkin–Anh/Zimmerman–Traxler models to control stereochemistry  
C. Only the first step determines all stereocenters; the subsequent steps are stereochemically irrelevant  
D. The purpose of switching between enolate, enamine, and silyl enol ether is solely to change reaction temperature, not reactivity or selectivity  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The kinetic enolate controls α‑regiochemistry under strong basic conditions, the enamine allows mild, neutral conjugate addition (Stork/Michael‑type) compatible with sensitive groups, and the silyl enol ether serves as a stable enolate equivalent for Lewis acid–mediated Mukaiyama aldol.  Throughout, stereocenters created in carbonyl additions and aldol steps can be predicted and designed using Cram/Felkin–Anh models for carbonyl additions and Zimmerman–Traxler analysis for aldol syn/anti outcomes, embodying the integration goal of the learning unit.  Claiming random choice, single‑step stereocontrol, or merely temperature adjustment ignores how these distinct enolate‑type nucleophiles and stereochemical models are deliberately combined in multistep synthesis.
