1) In a polarimetry experiment, **specific rotation** \([\alpha]\) is defined as the observed rotation divided by which product?

A. Wavelength \(\times\) time  
B. Path length \(\times\) concentration  
C. Temperature \(\times\) concentration  
D. Path length \(\times\) refractive index  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Specific rotation normalizes the observed rotation \(\alpha_{\text{obs}}\) for the amount of sample and the optical path, so \([\alpha] = \alpha_{\text{obs}}/(l\,c)\) (with \(l\) as path length and \(c\) as concentration, in the standard units used for polarimetry).  This makes \([\alpha]\) a characteristic property for a given compound at a specified temperature and wavelength, enabling comparison across experiments.  The other options mix in variables that are not part of the defining normalization (temperature and wavelength must be reported, but they do not appear in the denominator definition; refractive index is not used in this basic definition).

2) A sample has 70% of the \(R\) enantiomer and 30% of the \(S\) enantiomer. The enantiomeric excess (ee) is:

A. 40%  
B. 70%  
C. 30%  
D. 100%  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Enantiomeric excess is defined as \(\%ee = |\%R-\%S|\).  Here, \(|70-30|=40\%\), which measures optical purity relative to a racemic mixture.  The 70% and 30% values are composition percentages, not the excess over the opposite enantiomer, and 100% would require a single enantiomer only.   

3) In thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the retention factor \(R_f\) is best described as:

A. Distance travelled by solvent front divided by distance travelled by solute spot  
B. Distance travelled by solute spot divided by distance travelled by solvent front  
C. Time taken for solute spot to appear  
D. Ratio of stationary-phase mass to mobile-phase volume  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: \(R_f\) is defined as \(\text{distance traveled by analyte (spot)}/\text{distance traveled by solvent front}\).  It is a dimensionless number used for qualitative comparison under the same TLC conditions (same stationary phase, solvent system, and development).  Swapping numerator/denominator gives values typically greater than 1, which is inconsistent with standard TLC definitions, while time and phase-mass ratios are not part of \(R_f\).

4) On silica gel TLC (polar stationary phase), which compound typically shows the **lowest** \(R_f\) in a nonpolar mobile phase?

A. Toluene  
B. Aniline  
C. Hexane  
D. Ethyl acetate  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In adsorption-based TLC on polar silica, more polar compounds interact more strongly with the stationary phase and thus move less, giving lower \(R_f\).  Aniline is relatively polar and can interact strongly with silica (including acid–base type interactions), so it tends to have a lower \(R_f\) than less polar hydrocarbons like hexane or toluene.  Ethyl acetate is more polar than hydrocarbons but is typically less strongly retained than aniline on silica under similar conditions.

5) In column chromatography, separation primarily occurs because components differ in their:

A. Boiling points  
B. Adsorption/partition interactions between stationary and mobile phases  
C. Magnetic susceptibility  
D. Nuclear spin states  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Column chromatography separates compounds based on differential interaction with the stationary phase versus the mobile phase, leading to different migration/elution rates.  Boiling point differences are central to distillation and GC volatility trends, not the core mechanism of classical adsorption column chromatography.  Magnetic susceptibility and nuclear spin are relevant to other techniques (e.g., NMR-related phenomena) and are not the basis of column chromatographic separation.

6) In reverse-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is typically:

A. Polar (e.g., bare silica) and the mobile phase is nonpolar  
B. Nonpolar (e.g., C18-bonded silica) and the mobile phase is relatively polar  
C. Gas phase in a capillary column  
D. A salt bridge with an applied voltage  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Reverse-phase HPLC uses a nonpolar/hydrophobic stationary phase (commonly C18) and a comparatively polar mobile phase (often water–organic solvent mixtures).  This inverts (“reverses”) the polarity arrangement relative to normal-phase chromatography.  Gas-phase capillary columns describe GC, and salt bridge/electrodes describe electroanalytical setups rather than HPLC.

7) Gas chromatography (GC) is most suitable for analyzing compounds that are:

A. Nonvolatile and thermally unstable  
B. Highly ionic solids  
C. Volatile and thermally stable enough for vaporization  
D. Only strongly UV-absorbing  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: GC requires the analyte to be vaporized and transported by a carrier gas through the column, so volatility and sufficient thermal stability are key.  Nonvolatile/thermally unstable or ionic solid analytes are generally unsuitable without derivatization or alternative techniques.  UV absorption is relevant for UV detectors in some liquid-phase methods, not a core requirement for GC suitability.

8) The Beer–Lambert law relates absorbance \(A\) to concentration \(c\) primarily as:

A. \(A = \varepsilon l c\)  
B. \(A = \varepsilon/(lc)\)  
C. \(A = lc/\varepsilon\)  
D. \(A = \varepsilon + l + c\)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Beer–Lambert law states \(A=\varepsilon l c\), where \(\varepsilon\) is molar absorptivity and \(l\) is path length.  This is used for quantitative UV–Vis analysis when the system obeys linearity in the chosen concentration range.  The other expressions incorrectly invert or add terms and do not represent the proportional relationship used in UV–Vis quantification.

9) In IR spectroscopy, a strong absorption near \(\sim 1700\ \text{cm}^{-1}\) is most commonly associated with:

A. O–H stretching vibration  
B. C=O stretching vibration  
C. C–H bending in alkanes  
D. C–C stretching in aromatic rings  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: The \(\sim 1700\ \text{cm}^{-1}\) region is characteristic of carbonyl (C=O) stretching in many functional groups (ketones, aldehydes, acids, esters with shifts).  O–H stretches are typically much higher (broad bands around the 3200–3600 \(\text{cm}^{-1}\) region), while many C–H bending and aromatic C–C stretches generally occur elsewhere.  Using this diagnostic band is part of functional group region interpretation in IR.

10) In \(^{1}\)H NMR spectroscopy, which statement is most correct about **integration** of signals?

A. It gives the number of carbon atoms responsible for each signal  
B. It gives the relative number of protons contributing to each signal  
C. It directly gives the coupling constant \(J\) values  
D. It identifies the molecular ion peak  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: In \(^{1}\)H NMR, integration corresponds to the relative area under each resonance and therefore the relative number of equivalent protons producing that signal.  The number of carbons is obtained from \(^{13}\)C NMR (with considerations like NOE/relaxation), while coupling constants come from splitting spacings rather than integrals.  The molecular ion peak is a mass spectrometry concept, not an NMR integration output.
