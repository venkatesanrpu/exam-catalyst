1) A conjugated triene undergoes a thermal electrocyclic ring closure to a cyclohexadiene. If the system involves six π-electrons in the ground state, the stereochemical mode of ring closure is expected to be:

A. Conrotatory, because thermal 4n systems close conrotatorily  
B. Disrotatory, because thermal 4n+2 systems close disrotatorily  
C. Conrotatory, because thermal 4n+2 systems close conrotatorily  
D. Disrotatory, because thermal 4n systems close disrotatorily  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For electrocyclic reactions, Woodward–Hoffmann rules state that thermal 4n+2 π-electron systems (e.g., 6 π-electron triene) undergo disrotatory ring closure, while thermal 4n π-electron systems (e.g., 4 π-electron diene) undergo conrotatory closure. The incorrect options either mix up 4n and 4n+2 classifications or swap the associated stereomodes, which is a common exam misconception.

2) A substituted diene undergoes a Diels–Alder [4+2] cycloaddition with an electron-poor alkene. Using FMO analysis, which interaction mainly controls the reaction feasibility?

A. HOMO(diene)–LUMO(dienophile) overlap leading to bonding interactions  
B. LUMO(diene)–LUMO(dienophile) overlap lowering overall energy  
C. HOMO(dienophile)–HOMO(diene) overlap stabilizing the ground state  
D. Overlap of core orbitals, which are least affected by substituents  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In a typical Diels–Alder reaction, the diene is electron-rich and the dienophile is electron-poor, so the key interaction is between the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile, which dictates reaction rate and orientation. LUMO–LUMO or HOMO–HOMO overlaps are not symmetry-matched driving forces, and core orbitals are energetically too deep and not involved in bonding changes; assuming they govern reactivity is a common error.

3) Consider a thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between two simple alkenes. Using orbital symmetry rules, this process is:

A. Symmetry-forbidden in a purely concerted thermal pathway  
B. Symmetry-allowed thermally but forbidden photochemically  
C. Allowed both thermally and photochemically in concerted fashion  
D. Forbidden under all conditions and must proceed stepwise  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: For simple alkenes, a concerted thermal [2+2] cycloaddition is symmetry-forbidden by Woodward–Hoffmann rules because the required orbital phase alignment cannot be achieved in the ground state. Under photochemical excitation, one alkene’s orbital occupancy changes, making [2+2] cycloadditions symmetry-allowed; claiming they are forbidden photochemically or under all conditions ignores the excited-state correlation analysis.

4) A -sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether proceeds thermally. According to sigmatropic nomenclature and orbital symmetry, this rearrangement:

A. Is a concerted pericyclic process involving six electrons in a cyclic transition state  
B. Proceeds stepwise via discrete radical intermediates by definition  
C. Always requires photochemical activation to be symmetry-allowed  
D. Is classified as a -shift because one group moves five atoms away

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: A -sigmatropic shift (such as the Claisen rearrangement) is a concerted pericyclic rearrangement with a six-electron cyclic transition state that is thermally allowed and follows Woodward–Hoffmann rules. Stepwise radical or ionic pathways are not inherent to sigmatropic classification, and photochemical activation is not required for its symmetry-allowedness. Calling it  miscounts the connectivity change and reflects confusion between different sigmatropic orders.

5) For a 4 π-electron butadiene undergoing electrocyclic ring closure, how does photochemical activation change the stereochemical mode relative to the thermal case?

A. Thermal: conrotatory; photochemical: disrotatory  
B. Thermal: disrotatory; photochemical: conrotatory  
C. Both thermal and photochemical: disrotatory  
D. Both thermal and photochemical: conrotatory  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: A 4 π-electron system follows the rule that thermal electrocyclic closure is conrotatory, whereas photochemical excitation inverts the selection rules, giving a disrotatory mode. Saying both pathways share the same rotation mode ignores the fundamental thermal–photochemical complementarity of Woodward–Hoffmann rules and is a frequent conceptual mistake.

6) In cis–trans photoisomerization of a simple alkene, which statement best reflects the role of excited states?

A. Promotion to an excited state reduces the effective π-bond order, allowing rotation around the C–C bond  
B. Excitation strengthens the π-bond, preventing any rotation and locking configuration  
C. Only n-π* excitation is possible for alkenes, which never leads to isomerization  
D. Photoisomerization must always proceed through a carbocation intermediate  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Upon electronic excitation, the π–π* transition reduces the effective bond order between the alkene carbons, facilitating rotation around what was a rigid double bond, so cis and trans forms can interconvert before relaxation. Strengthening the bond or insisting only n-π* states exist contradicts alkene UV–vis behavior, and invoking carbocation intermediates misattributes a polar, stepwise mechanism to a process that is fundamentally excited-state and often near-concerted.

7) A carbonyl compound primarily excited to its n-π* state displays Norrish type-II reactivity. Which key step initiates this pathway?

A. γ-C–H abstraction by the excited carbonyl oxygen, generating a 1,4-diradical  
B. Direct α-cleavage next to the carbonyl, forming two radical fragments  
C. Concerted [2+2] cycloaddition with another carbonyl to give an oxetane  
D. Deprotonation at the α-position by base to form an enolate  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Norrish type-II cleavage begins with intramolecular γ-hydrogen abstraction by the excited carbonyl (often n-π*), producing a 1,4-diradical that can undergo β-scission or cyclization. Direct α-cleavage is Norrish type-I, while [2+2] cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes corresponds to Paternò–Büchi chemistry. Base-generated enolates are ground-state ionic species, not photochemically initiated diradicals.

8) A photochemical process generates singlet oxygen using a sensitizer. Which description best matches the roles of reactants?

A. The sensitizer absorbs light, reaches an excited state, and transfers energy to ground-state oxygen, forming reactive singlet oxygen  
B. Oxygen absorbs light directly and becomes a strong nucleophile for substitution  
C. The substrate absorbs light and donates two electrons to oxygen, forming peroxide without any sensitizer involvement  
D. The sensitizer only acts as a stoichiometric oxidant consumed in each cycle  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: In sensitized photooxidation, a chromophoric sensitizer absorbs light, undergoes intersystem crossing to a triplet state, and transfers energy to ground-state triplet oxygen, populating the reactive singlet oxygen state that then reacts with substrates. Oxygen does not typically act as a simple nucleophile in this context, and direct two-electron transfer from substrate to oxygen bypasses the defining role of the sensitizer. Treating the sensitizer as stoichiometrically consumed ignores its catalytic, cyclic function.

9) In a di-π-methane rearrangement of an aryl-substituted 1,4-diene under UV light, which feature is crucial for enabling the rearrangement pathway?

A. Presence of two π-systems connected by a saturated carbon that can form a three-center intermediate  
B. Existence of a strong leaving group that departs to generate a carbocation  
C. Necessity of a metal catalyst to provide vacant d-orbitals for backbonding  
D. Requirement that the molecule be fully aromatic before irradiation  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The di-π-methane rearrangement involves an excited 1,4-diene (or similar system) where two π-systems flank a saturated center; excitation allows formation of a transient three-center arrangement and subsequent skeletal rearrangement. Leaving groups and carbocations are not characteristic steps, and no metal catalyst or pre-existing aromaticity is required; suggesting either is confusing this named photorearrangement with unrelated substitution or organometallic processes.

10) In the Barton–McCombie deoxygenation, an alcohol is converted via its xanthate ester and irradiated. Which mechanistic feature best characterizes this photochemical transformation?

A. Homolytic cleavage of the xanthate under photolysis, generating carbon-centered radicals that lead to C–O bond removal  
B. Direct SN2 displacement of the xanthate by hydride, giving the corresponding alkane in one step  
C. Concerted [4+2] cycloaddition of the xanthate to the alcohol, forming a cyclic sulfate intermediate  
D. Purely thermal E2 elimination of the xanthate, followed by hydrogenation  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The Barton–McCombie reaction proceeds through radical intermediates: photolysis of a xanthate ester leads to radical formation, and subsequent radical steps ultimately replace the hydroxyl group by hydrogen, effecting deoxygenation. SN2 displacement by hydride, [4+2] cycloadditions, or simple E2 pathways with later hydrogenation do not capture the radical, photochemical nature defined in the learning path and represent common but incorrect mechanistic assumptions.
