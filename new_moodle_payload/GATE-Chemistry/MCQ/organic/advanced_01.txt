1) A substrate \(\mathrm{(R)\!-\!CH(OTs)\!-\!CH_2\!-\!SMe}\) undergoes solvolysis in a polar protic solvent. The major stereochemical outcome at the carbon bearing OTs is most consistent with:

A. Predominant inversion, because the mechanism must be classical \(\mathrm{S_N2}\)  
B. Predominant racemization, because a free planar carbocation forms and rotates freely  
C. Predominant retention (often via double-inversion overall), due to neighbouring group participation by sulfur forming a bridged intermediate  
D. No substitution, because neighbouring group participation always blocks ionization  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: Neighbouring group participation (anchimeric assistance) occurs when a neighboring heteroatom (here sulfur) donates electron density to stabilize developing positive charge and forms a bridged intermediate. This changes both rate and stereochemical course: the initial intramolecular participation can produce inversion at the carbon (as the bridge forms), and subsequent opening of the bridged intermediate by external nucleophile often gives a second inversion, leading to net retention overall (or strong deviation from simple \(\mathrm{S_N1}\) racemization). A purely \(\mathrm{S_N2}\) pathway is unlikely for solvolysis conditions and would not invoke a bridged intermediate. A fully free carbocation would predict substantial racemization, but anchimeric assistance typically reduces “free-ion” character by internal trapping. Neighbouring group participation does not stop reaction; it usually accelerates it and controls stereochemistry.

2) For a disubstituted cyclohexane, a reaction requires an anti-periplanar arrangement between a leaving group and a \(\beta\)-hydrogen (E2-like stereoelectronic requirement). Which statement best captures the conformational logic needed to predict the major elimination stereochemistry?

A. Any chair conformer works because rotation about \(\sigma\) bonds always provides anti-periplanar alignment in rings  
B. The leaving group must be equatorial to be antiperiplanar to a \(\beta\)-hydrogen  
C. The leaving group must be axial so that an axial \(\beta\)-hydrogen can align anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial requirement), making conformational analysis decisive  
D. The reaction is controlled only by Zaitsev substitution pattern, independent of conformation  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: In cyclohexane chairs, the stereoelectronic requirement for E2 is typically met through a trans-diaxial arrangement: the leaving group must be axial and the eliminated \(\beta\)-hydrogen must be axial on the adjacent carbon (anti-periplanar in the chair). This forces the predictor to first identify the populated chair conformer(s) and then see whether a trans-diaxial pair exists. Assuming “any conformer works” ignores that rings restrict dihedral angles. An equatorial leaving group generally cannot achieve the needed anti-periplanar geometry in a cyclohexane chair without ring flip. Zaitsev considerations matter only after the stereoelectronic feasibility is satisfied.

3) A biaryl with bulky ortho substituents shows two isolable enantiomeric forms at room temperature, despite having no tetrahedral stereogenic centre. The best explanation is:

A. The molecule is meso due to an internal mirror plane  
B. The molecule exhibits atropisomerism due to restricted rotation about the aryl–aryl bond, creating stable conformational enantiomers  
C. The molecule is achiral but becomes optically active only in chiral solvents  
D. The molecule must rapidly interconvert, so isolable enantiomers are impossible  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: Atropisomerism arises when rotation about a single bond (commonly the biaryl bond) is sufficiently hindered that conformers become configurationally stable and can be isolated as enantiomers. This is a form of chirality without a traditional stereogenic centre, consistent with the “restricted rotation” concept. A meso compound is achiral due to internal symmetry and would not yield an enantiomeric pair. Optical activity “only in chiral solvents” confuses induced CD/solvent effects with the existence of isolable enantiomers; the isolability implies a real rotational barrier and persistent chirality. Rapid interconversion would indeed prevent isolation, which is precisely why restricted rotation is the key condition.

4) For nucleophilic addition to an \(\alpha\)-heteroatom-substituted chiral aldehyde (for example, an \(\alpha\)-alkoxy aldehyde), which predictive framework most appropriately rationalizes the major diastereomer when chelation is disfavored and electronic effects matter?

A. Only the original Cram model based purely on “largest group blocks attack”  
B. Felkin–Anh type reasoning emphasizing preferred conformations and stereoelectronic/electronic effects of the C–X bond  
C. E/Z nomenclature rules because the carbonyl is planar  
D. Chair conformational analysis of cyclohexane  

Correct answer: B  

Explanation: For \(\alpha\)-heteroatom-substituted carbonyls under non-chelating conditions, Felkin–Anh reasoning is widely used: it combines steric approach control with conformational preferences and electronic effects associated with the \(\alpha\)-C–X bond. A purely steric “largest group” model can fail when electronegative substituents alter the preferred conformation and transition-state stabilization. E/Z nomenclature is irrelevant because it describes alkene geometry, not facial selectivity at carbonyl addition. Chair analysis applies to cyclic conformations like cyclohexanes and is not the general framework for acyclic \(\alpha\)-chiral aldehydes.

5) A molecule contains two stereogenic centres and no symmetry elements (no mirror plane, no inversion centre, no improper axis). Under these conditions, how many stereoisomers are expected, and what stereochemical relationships must be present?

A. Exactly 2 stereoisomers, which must be enantiomers  
B. Exactly 3 stereoisomers, because one must be meso  
C. Up to 4 stereoisomers, consisting of two enantiomeric pairs that are diastereomeric to each other  
D. Exactly 4 stereoisomers, all of which are enantiomers of each other  

Correct answer: C  

Explanation: With two stereogenic centres, the maximum is \(2^2=4\) stereoisomers. The absence of symmetry elements rules out a meso form, so the full set of four is expected: \((R,R)\), \((S,S)\), \((R,S)\), and \((S,R)\). These group into two enantiomeric pairs: \((R,R)\) vs \((S,S)\) and \((R,S)\) vs \((S,R)\), and any member of one pair is diastereomeric with any member of the other pair. The common error is to claim “all four are enantiomers”; enantiomerism is strictly pairwise and requires mirror-image relationship.
