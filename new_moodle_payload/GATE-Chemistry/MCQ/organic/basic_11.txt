1) In carbohydrate chemistry, the term **mutarotation** refers to:
A. Interconversion between anomers via ring opening and reclosing, causing a change in optical rotation  
B. Conversion of an aldose to a ketose by base-catalyzed rearrangement without ring opening  
C. Formation of a glycosidic bond between two monosaccharides  
D. Oxidation of an aldose to an aldonic acid  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Mutarotation is the change in optical rotation observed when a cyclic sugar equilibrates between its \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) anomeric forms through an open-chain intermediate, followed by ring closure.  Interconversion without ring opening does not allow the anomeric configuration to change, so an open-chain step is essential.  Aldose–ketose isomerization (option B) is a different process (enediol rearrangement), glycosidic bond formation (option C) locks the anomeric carbon and typically prevents mutarotation at that center, and oxidation (option D) changes functional groups rather than anomer ratios.

2) A monosaccharide is classified as an **aldose** when it contains:
A. An aldehyde functional group (in its open-chain form)  
B. A ketone functional group (in its open-chain form)  
C. An amide functional group  
D. A carboxylic acid functional group  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Aldoses are monosaccharides whose open-chain form contains an aldehyde group (typically at C-1).  Ketoses instead contain a ketone group (commonly at C-2), while amide and carboxylic acid functionalities are not the defining criteria for aldose/ketose classification.

***

3) In carbohydrate stereochemistry, two monosaccharides that differ in configuration at exactly one stereogenic center (not the anomeric carbon) are called:
A. Epimers  
B. Enantiomers  
C. Anomers  
D. Conformers  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Epimers differ at only one chiral center (excluding the anomeric center if discussing ring forms in that context).  Enantiomers differ at all stereocenters (mirror images), anomers differ only at the anomeric carbon, and conformers differ by rotation about single bonds rather than configuration changes.

***

4) A disaccharide is **non-reducing** when:
A. Both anomeric carbons are involved in the glycosidic linkage, leaving no free hemiacetal/hemiketal  
B. It contains at least one fructose unit  
C. It contains only \(1\rightarrow 6\) glycosidic linkages  
D. Its monosaccharide units are both in the D-series  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Reducing behavior requires a free anomeric carbon that can open to the carbonyl form; if both anomeric centers are tied up in the glycosidic bond, the disaccharide cannot form the open-chain aldehyde/ketone needed for reducing tests.  The presence of fructose, the linkage position alone, or D/L series does not by itself determine reducing vs non-reducing character.

***

5) The **zwitterionic** nature of amino acids at near-neutral pH is best described as:
A. The molecule contains both \(\mathrm{-NH_3^+}\) and \(\mathrm{-COO^-}\) groups simultaneously  
B. The molecule exists only as an uncharged neutral form \(\mathrm{-NH_2}\) and \(\mathrm{-COOH}\)  
C. The amino acid is fully protonated at all functional groups  
D. The amino acid is fully deprotonated at all functional groups  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Amino acids commonly exist as internal salts (zwitterions) with a protonated amino group and a deprotonated carboxyl group, which explains their high melting points and aqueous behavior.  The fully neutral form is usually a minor contributor in water, while “fully protonated” or “fully deprotonated” apply only at extreme pH conditions, not near neutral pH.

***

6) The **isoelectric point (pI)** of an amino acid is the pH at which:
A. The net charge of the amino acid is zero  
B. The amino acid has maximum solubility in water  
C. The amino acid exists only in the fully protonated form  
D. The amino acid exists only in the fully deprotonated form  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The isoelectric point is defined as the pH where the average (net) charge is zero, so the zwitterionic form predominates.  Solubility is often minimal (not maximal) near pI due to reduced electrostatic repulsion, and fully protonated/deprotonated forms occur at sufficiently low/high pH, respectively.

***

7) The **peptide bond** formed between two amino acids is best described as a:
A. Covalent amide linkage formed between the \(\alpha\)-carboxyl group of one amino acid and the \(\alpha\)-amino group of another  
B. Disulfide bond formed between two cysteine side chains  
C. Hydrogen bond formed between backbone \(\mathrm{N-H}\) and \(\mathrm{C=O}\) groups  
D. Ionic salt bridge formed between acidic and basic side chains  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: A peptide bond is an amide bond created by condensation between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, producing a covalent linkage in peptides and proteins.  Disulfide bonds and salt bridges are side-chain interactions, while hydrogen bonds stabilize secondary structure but are not the covalent linkage connecting residues.

***

8) The **secondary structure** element primarily stabilized by intrachain hydrogen bonding in a regular helical pattern is:
A. \(\alpha\)-Helix  
B. Quaternary structure  
C. Primary structure  
D. Random coil only (no defined H-bonding pattern possible)  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: The \(\alpha\)-helix is a classic secondary structure stabilized by regular hydrogen bonds between backbone \(\mathrm{C=O}\) and \(\mathrm{N-H}\) groups along the same chain.  Primary structure is just the amino acid sequence, quaternary structure refers to multi-subunit assembly, and random coil lacks a consistent repeating hydrogen-bonding geometry.

***

9) In nucleic acids, the bond linking nucleotides into a strand is the:
A. Phosphodiester bond  
B. Glycosidic bond between base and sugar only  
C. Peptide bond  
D. Disulfide bond  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Nucleotides polymerize through phosphodiester linkages that connect the sugar–phosphate backbone of DNA/RNA.  The glycosidic bond attaches the nitrogenous base to the sugar within a nucleotide, while peptide and disulfide bonds are characteristic of proteins.

***

10) A **triglyceride** is structurally best described as:
A. A triester of glycerol with three fatty acids  
B. An amide of glycerol with three amino acids  
C. A phosphodiester of glycerol with two fatty acids and a phosphate-linked headgroup  
D. A polymer of isoprene units  

Correct answer: A  

Explanation: Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) are formed when all three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are esterified with fatty acids.  Phosphodiester-containing glycerol lipids correspond to phospholipids (option C), while options B and D describe different biomolecule classes altogether.
