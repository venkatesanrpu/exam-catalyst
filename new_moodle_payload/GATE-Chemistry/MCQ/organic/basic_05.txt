The 10 basic-level MCQs below are aligned to Organic Chemistry (GATE Chemistry), focusing on carbon–carbon bond formation via cross-coupling and related reactions from the attached unit. Each question has four options with one correct answer, followed by an explanation matching the Basic difficulty specifications.

1) In a generic Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling, which step forms the new C–C bond?
A. Oxidative addition  
B. Transmetalation  
C. Reductive elimination  
D. β-Hydride elimination  

Correct answer: C  
Explanation: In palladium cross-coupling, oxidative addition inserts Pd into the C–X bond of the electrophile, transmetalation transfers the nucleophilic carbon to Pd, and reductive elimination couples the two carbons to form the C–C bond; β-hydride elimination does not form C–C bonds in these cycles.

2) Which coupling employs boronic acids or boronic esters as the nucleophilic partners?
A. Stille  
B. Suzuki–Miyaura  
C. Negishi  
D. Kumada  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Suzuki–Miyaura coupling uniquely uses organoboron reagents (boronic acids/esters) with a base to promote transmetalation, offering high functional group tolerance; Stille uses organotin, Negishi uses organozinc, and Kumada uses organomagnesium reagents.

3) The Heck reaction typically couples an aryl or vinyl halide with:
A. An alkyne  
B. An alkene  
C. An organozinc reagent  
D. A boronic acid  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: The Heck reaction is a Pd-catalyzed aryl/vinyl–alkene coupling proceeding via oxidative addition, alkene insertion, and β-hydride elimination to give substituted alkenes; alkynes are characteristic of Sonogashira, while organozinc and boronic acids belong to Negishi and Suzuki couplings, respectively.

4) Which coupling classically requires a copper(I) co-catalyst to activate terminal alkynes?
A. Sonogashira  
B. Hiyama  
C. Stille  
D. Tsuji–Trost  

Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Sonogashira coupling forms aryl–alkynyl bonds by deprotonating terminal alkynes, often via a Cu(I) alkynide intermediate that transmetalates to Pd; Hiyama uses organosilanes with fluoride, Stille uses organotin reagents, and Tsuji–Trost is an allylic substitution, not an alkyne coupling.

5) Which statement best describes oxidative addition in cross-coupling?
A. Pd(0) inserts into a C–X bond to give Pd(II)  
B. Pd(II) eliminates to form a C–C bond  
C. Transfer of R group from M to Pd center  
D. Base activation of boron reagent  

Correct answer: A  
Explanation: Oxidative addition converts Pd(0) to Pd(II) by inserting into the carbon–halide (or pseudohalide) bond; reductive elimination forms the C–C bond, transmetalation transfers the organic group from the nucleophile (e.g., B, Zn, Sn), and base activation is specifically relevant to Suzuki transmetalation.

6) Which organometallic coupling partner is noted for toxicity concerns despite broad scope?
A. Organosilane  
B. Organotin  
C. Organoboron  
D. Organozinc  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Stille coupling leverages organotin reagents that are effective and versatile but raise environmental and health concerns; organoboron reagents are low-toxicity and user-friendly, organozinc are more reactive yet compatible, and organosilanes are relatively benign but require fluoride activation.

7) In the Hiyama coupling, efficient transmetalation commonly requires:
A. Copper(I) salt  
B. Fluoride source  
C. Strong base only  
D. Photocatalyst  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Hiyama coupling involves organosilanes that are activated by fluoride to facilitate Si–C to Pd transmetalation under mild conditions; copper(I) is typical of Sonogashira, strong base alone is insufficient for Hiyama, and photocatalysts are not inherent to this classical method.

8) Which reaction is an example of palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution rather than cross-coupling?
A. Kumada  
B. Tsuji–Trost  
C. Negishi  
D. Suzuki–Miyaura  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Tsuji–Trost proceeds via a π-allyl–Pd intermediate, enabling nucleophilic substitution at allylic positions with control over regio- and enantioselectivity; Kumada, Negishi, and Suzuki are cross-couplings forming C–C bonds via transmetalation from Mg, Zn, and B reagents respectively.

9) Olefin metathesis proceeds through which key intermediate?
A. π-Allyl palladium  
B. Metallacyclobutane  
C. Aryl–Pd(IV) species  
D. Cu(I) acetylide  

Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Ruthenium alkylidene catalysts mediate olefin metathesis via a [2+2] cycloaddition to a metallacyclobutane followed by cycloreversion; π-allyl Pd belongs to Tsuji–Trost, Pd(IV) is not the canonical intermediate here, and Cu(I) acetylide is associated with Sonogashira.

10) The McMurry reaction couples two carbonyl compounds to form:
A. A diol via pinacol coupling only  
B. An alkane via full reduction  
C. An alkene via reductive coupling  
D. An alkyne via deoxygenation  

Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Low-valent titanium species generated in McMurry conditions couple two carbonyls through a pinacol-like intermediate and reductive elimination to give an alkene; the net transformation is reductive olefination, not diol formation (that is the intermediate state) nor full reduction to alkanes or formation of alkynes.
