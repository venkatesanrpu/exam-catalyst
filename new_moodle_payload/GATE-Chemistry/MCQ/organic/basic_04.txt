Here are 10 basic-level GATE Organic Chemistry MCQs based on the attached “GATE Organic Synthesis Learning Path” (organic_unit_04.txt). Questions focus on definitions, core mechanisms, rules, and fundamental outcomes across alkenes/alkynes, aromatic substitution, alcohols/phenols, carbonyls, carboxylic acid derivatives, halides/nitro, amines/amides, organometallics, and selective synthesis planning.

1) In electrophilic addition of HBr to propene under normal conditions, the major product forms according to which guiding rule?  
A. Zaitsev rule  
B. Hofmann rule  
C. Markovnikov rule  
D. Hammond rule  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Hydrohalogenation of alkenes follows Markovnikov’s rule: the proton adds to the carbon bearing more hydrogens, forming the more stable carbocation and ultimately the more substituted alkyl bromide (2-bromopropane). Zaitsev and Hofmann guide elimination regioselectivity, not electrophilic addition. Hammond postulate relates transition-state structure to reaction energetics, not product regiochemistry here.

2) Hydroboration–oxidation of 1-hexene yields which regiochemical outcome for the alcohol?  
A. Markovnikov alcohol at C-2  
B. Anti-Markovnikov alcohol at C-1  
C. Equimolar mixture at C-1 and C-2  
D. No reaction under standard conditions  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Hydroboration places boron at the less substituted carbon, and subsequent oxidation replaces B with OH, giving the anti-Markovnikov alcohol (1-hexanol). The reaction proceeds with syn addition but the key beginner takeaway is anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry for the alcohol. Markovnikov placement is incorrect for this sequence.

3) In halogenation of an alkene (e.g., ethene + Br2), what intermediate accounts for anti addition?  
A. Carbocation  
B. Bromonium ion  
C. Radical cation  
D. Carbanion  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Addition of Br2 to alkenes proceeds via a cyclic halonium ion (bromonium). Backside attack of Br− breaks the three-membered ring, giving trans vicinal dibromides (anti addition). Carbocations are typical of HX addition; radical routes require initiators; carbanions are not involved here.

4) Which statement best describes electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) on benzene?  
A. The ring is nucleophilic and attacks an electrophile.  
B. The ring is electrophilic and is attacked by a nucleophile.  
C. Reaction proceeds via benzyne intermediate under basic conditions.  
D. Reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with Meisenheimer intermediate.  
Correct answer: A  
Explanation: In EAS, the aromatic ring acts as a nucleophile, attacking an electrophile to form a σ-complex (arenium ion) before rearomatization. Benzyne and Meisenheimer intermediates are characteristic of nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathways, not EAS.

5) A nitro group on a benzene ring typically directs incoming electrophiles to which positions and with what ring effect?  
A. Ortho/para; activating  
B. Meta; deactivating  
C. Ortho/para; deactivating  
D. Meta; activating  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Nitro is a strong electron-withdrawing group that deactivates the ring toward EAS and directs electrophiles to the meta position due to destabilization of ortho/para σ-complex resonance structures involving the electron-withdrawing substituent.

6) Which reagent set best oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone without overoxidation?  
A. Jones reagent in water  
B. PCC in dichloromethane  
C. NaBH4 in methanol  
D. LiAlH4 in ether  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: PCC (in organic solvent) oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones efficiently and oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes without overoxidation to acids. Jones is aqueous and can overoxidize primary alcohols; NaBH4 and LiAlH4 are reducing agents, not oxidants.

7) In the general mechanism of nucleophilic addition to a simple aldehyde or ketone, what key intermediate forms first?  
A. Carbocation  
B. Tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate  
C. Radical intermediate  
D. Acyl cation  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Nucleophilic addition to carbonyls occurs via attack at the electrophilic carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate, which upon protonation yields the addition product. Carbocations and radicals are not standard intermediates for basic nucleophilic additions to neutral carbonyls.

8) The fundamental step type for converting acyl chlorides to esters or amides is best described as:  
A. Electrophilic aromatic substitution  
B. Nucleophilic acyl substitution via tetrahedral intermediate  
C. Radical chain substitution  
D. Pericyclic cycloaddition  
Correct answer: B  
Explanation: Carboxylic acid derivatives undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution: nucleophile addition to give a tetrahedral intermediate followed by collapse with loss of leaving group (e.g., Cl−), forming esters or amides. The other options describe unrelated mechanisms.

9) Which statement about SN1 vs SN2 of alkyl halides is most accurate?  
A. SN2 is favored by tertiary halides in polar protic solvents.  
B. SN1 proceeds with backside attack and inversion of configuration.  
C. SN2 is bimolecular, sensitive to steric hindrance, and prefers primary substrates.  
D. SN1 is bimolecular and accelerated by strong nucleophiles only.  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: SN2 is a single-step, bimolecular process with backside attack and is hindered by sterics, making primary substrates most favorable. SN1 is unimolecular via carbocations, often in polar protic solvents and with tertiary substrates; it can lead to racemization rather than strict inversion.

10) Which pairing correctly matches an organometallic reagent with a characteristic use?  
A. RMgX; selective 1,4-conjugate addition over 1,2-addition  
B. RLi; milder and more chemoselective than RMgX toward acidic protons  
C. R2CuLi; conjugate (1,4) addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls  
D. BH3; direct nucleophilic attack on carbonyls to give alcohols  
Correct answer: C  
Explanation: Gilman reagents (cuprates) are classic for 1,4-conjugate addition to enones. Organolithium reagents are typically more reactive/basic (less selective) than Grignards toward acidic sites. Grignards often add 1,2 to carbonyls. BH3 participates in hydroboration of alkenes/alkynes, not direct nucleophilic carbonyl additions in this context.
