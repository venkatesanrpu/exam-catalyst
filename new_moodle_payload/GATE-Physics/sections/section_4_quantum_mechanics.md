- Angular momentum and spin
- Addition of angular momenta

**Unit 4.5: Approximation Methods**

- Variational method and WKB approximation, time independent perturbation theory

**Unit 4.6: Scattering Theory**

- Elementary scattering theory, Born approximation

**Unit 4.7: Symmetries in Quantum Systems**

- Symmetries in quantum mechanical systems


### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 4.1** establishes the mathematical and conceptual framework, including postulates, uncertainty principle, and the mathematical language (Hilbert space formalism) needed for all subsequent topics.

**Unit 4.2** applies the Schrodinger equation to solvable one-dimensional problems, building intuition about quantum behavior in simple systems.

**Unit 4.3** extends to higher dimensions where degeneracy emerges, culminating in the hydrogen atom as the key three-dimensional central potential problem.

**Unit 4.4** separates angular momentum as a fundamental quantum observable requiring specialized treatment beyond spatial wavefunctions.

**Unit 4.5** groups approximation techniques for solving complex systems that lack exact solutions.

**Unit 4.6** isolates scattering as a distinct application requiring understanding of asymptotic behavior and transition amplitudes.

**Unit 4.7** places symmetries last as they represent an overarching principle that synthesizes concepts from previous units.
