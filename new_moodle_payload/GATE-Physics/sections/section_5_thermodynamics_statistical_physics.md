### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 5.1** establishes thermodynamic laws as the macroscopic foundation before introducing microscopic statistical descriptions.

**Unit 5.2** introduces the statistical mechanics framework by defining microstates, phase space, and ensemble concepts that connect macroscopic and microscopic descriptions.

**Unit 5.3** develops the mathematical machinery (partition function and free energy) used to calculate thermodynamic quantities from statistical mechanics.

**Unit 5.4** distinguishes between classical and quantum statistical treatments, forming the theoretical basis for subsequent applications.

**Unit 5.5** focuses on Fermi-Dirac statistics applications, specifically the degenerate Fermi gas.

**Unit 5.6** groups Bose-Einstein statistics applications together, covering both photon systems (black body radiation) and matter systems (Bose-Einstein condensation).

**Unit 5.7** addresses phase transitions as an advanced topic requiring integration of thermodynamic and statistical concepts from previous units.
