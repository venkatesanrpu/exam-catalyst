### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 7.1** establishes the structural foundation by covering crystal geometry and experimental determination methods.

**Unit 7.2** combines chemical bonding with lattice dynamics since both arise from interatomic interactions and affect thermal behavior.

**Unit 7.3** groups theoretical models (free electron and band theory) that explain electronic structure, forming the basis for understanding material properties.

**Unit 7.4** applies electronic structure theory to classify materials and understand charge transport phenomena.

**Unit 7.5** examines optical properties as interactions between photons and electronic states, requiring band theory understanding.

**Unit 7.6** focuses on dielectric response, connecting electronic structure to electric field interactions.

**Unit 7.7** addresses magnetic properties arising from electron spin and orbital moments, representing a distinct class of phenomena.

**Unit 7.8** isolates superconductivity as an advanced quantum phenomenon requiring comprehensive understanding of previous electronic and magnetic concepts.
