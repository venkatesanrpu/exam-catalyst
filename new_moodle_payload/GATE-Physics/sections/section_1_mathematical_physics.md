### Reorganized Units

**Unit 1.1: Linear Vector Spaces and Matrices**

- Linear vector space: basis, orthogonality and completeness
- Matrices; similarity transformations, diagonalization, eigen values and eigen vectors

**Unit 1.2: Differential Equations and Special Functions**

- Linear differential equations: second order linear differential equations and solutions involving special functions

**Unit 1.3: Complex Analysis**

- Complex analysis: Cauchy-Riemann conditions, Cauchy's theorem, singularities, residue theorem and applications

**Unit 1.4: Integral Transforms**

- Laplace transform, Fourier analysis

**Unit 1.5: Tensor Calculus**

- Elementary ideas about tensors: covariant and contravariant tensors


### Logic Behind the Split

The reorganization follows a **progressive complexity and conceptual clustering** approach:

**Unit 1.1** combines foundational linear algebra concepts that students need first, as matrices and vector spaces form the basis for many subsequent topics.

**Unit 1.2** isolates differential equations as a self-contained unit since it requires the linear algebra foundation but is distinct from complex analysis.

**Unit 1.3** groups all complex analysis topics together as they build upon each other sequentially (Cauchy-Riemann → Cauchy's theorem → singularities → residue theorem).

**Unit 1.4** separates transform methods (Laplace and Fourier) as practical computational tools that apply previously learned concepts.

**Unit 1.5** places tensors last as they represent an advanced generalization requiring understanding of vectors and transformations from Unit 1.1.

This structure allows students to master prerequisites before advancing to dependent topics.
