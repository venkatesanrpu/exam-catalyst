### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 9.1** presents measurable nuclear properties and binding energy systematics as the empirical foundation for nuclear physics.

**Unit 9.2** groups theoretical models explaining nuclear structure based on the properties from Unit 9.1.

**Unit 9.3** isolates nuclear force fundamentals and the two-body problem as the microscopic basis for nuclear interactions.

**Unit 9.4** covers spontaneous decay processes representing nuclear instability phenomena.

**Unit 9.5** addresses induced reactions and scattering, applying conservation laws to nuclear dynamics.

**Unit 9.6** separates large-scale energy release processes (fission/fusion) as practical applications.

**Unit 9.7** covers experimental tools bridging nuclear and particle physics studies.

**Unit 9.8** introduces particle classification, transitioning from nuclear to particle physics domain.

**Unit 9.9** presents the quark model as the fundamental theory underlying particle structure.

**Unit 9.10** consolidates symmetries and conservation laws as overarching principles governing both nuclear and particle phenomena.
