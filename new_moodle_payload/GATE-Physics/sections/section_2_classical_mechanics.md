### Reorganized Units

**Unit 2.1: Lagrangian Formulation Fundamentals**

- Lagrangian Formulation: D'Alembert's principle, Euler-Lagrange equation, Hamilton's principle, calculus of variations
- Symmetry and conservation laws

**Unit 2.2: Applications of Lagrangian Mechanics**

- Central force motion: Kepler problem and Rutherford scattering
- Small oscillations: coupled oscillations and normal modes

**Unit 2.3: Rigid Body Dynamics**

- Rigid body dynamics: interia tensor, orthogonal transformations, Euler angles, Torque free motion of a symmetric top

**Unit 2.4: Hamiltonian Mechanics**

- Hamiltonian and Hamilton's equations of motion
- Liouville's theorem

**Unit 2.5: Advanced Hamiltonian Formalism**

- Canonical transformations: action-angle variables, Poisson brackets, Hamilton-Jacobi equation

**Unit 2.6: Special Theory of Relativity**

- Special Theory of Relativity: Lorentz transformations, relativistic kinematics, mass-energy equivalence


### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 2.1** establishes the Lagrangian framework and its mathematical foundation, including the fundamental principles and the connection between symmetries and conservation laws.

**Unit 2.2** applies Lagrangian methods to specific physical systems, moving from central force problems to coupled oscillatory systems.

**Unit 2.3** isolates rigid body dynamics as it requires additional mathematical machinery (tensors, transformations) beyond basic Lagrangian mechanics.

**Unit 2.4** introduces the Hamiltonian formulation as an alternative framework, starting with basic concepts and Liouville's theorem.

**Unit 2.5** groups advanced Hamiltonian techniques that require mastery of Unit 2.4, representing sophisticated analytical methods.

**Unit 2.6** separates relativity as a conceptually distinct framework that modifies classical mechanics foundations.
