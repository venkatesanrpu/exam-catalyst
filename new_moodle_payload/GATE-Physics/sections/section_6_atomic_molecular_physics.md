### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 6.1** begins with basic atomic spectra, providing the observational foundation for understanding atomic structure.

**Unit 6.2** examines internal atomic interactions (spin-orbit coupling) and resulting fine/hyperfine structures, building on the spectral understanding from Unit 6.1.

**Unit 6.3** addresses external field perturbations (Zeeman and Stark effects) that modify atomic energy levels.

**Unit 6.4** focuses on transition mechanisms and selection rules governing atomic spectra.

**Unit 6.5** transitions from atoms to molecules, covering rotational and vibrational spectroscopy of diatomic systems.

**Unit 6.6** extends molecular spectroscopy to electronic transitions, including Franck-Condon principle and Raman scattering.

**Unit 6.7** groups specialized spectroscopic techniques (resonance and X-ray methods) as advanced experimental tools.

**Unit 6.8** separates laser physics as a distinct application requiring understanding of transition rates and population dynamics.
