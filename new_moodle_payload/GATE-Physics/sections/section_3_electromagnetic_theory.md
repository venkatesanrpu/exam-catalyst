### Logic Behind the Split

**Unit 3.1** consolidates static field problems and solution techniques, including material properties (dielectrics, conductors, magnetic materials) and multipole methods, forming the foundation for electromagnetic theory.

**Unit 3.2** presents the unifying theoretical framework through Maxwell's equations and introduces gauge formalism for potentials.

**Unit 3.3** transitions to time-varying fields by examining wave propagation in different media, applying Maxwell's equations dynamically.

**Unit 3.4** focuses on wave behavior at interfaces and polarization, representing practical electromagnetic phenomena.

**Unit 3.5** addresses energy transport and conservation through Poynting analysis, connecting field theory to physical observables.

**Unit 3.6** isolates radiation as an advanced application requiring understanding of time-varying fields and wave propagation.
