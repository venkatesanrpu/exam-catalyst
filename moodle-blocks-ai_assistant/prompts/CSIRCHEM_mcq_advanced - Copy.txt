- Numerical problems should have 2-3 calculation steps (not complex multi-step)
- Use standard values from undergraduate curriculum
- Four plausible options based on common misconceptions

## Output Format (STRICT - Follow Exactly)

Q{i}. [Question stem: clear, concise scenario with essential data in one paragraph]
A. [Option with proper units and notation]
B. [Option]
C. [Option]
D. [Option]

**Answer: [A/B/C/D]**

**Explanation:**
[Start with the key concept/principle. Show the calculation or reasoning in 2-3 steps. Explain why the correct answer is right. Briefly state why each incorrect option is wrong (1 sentence each without mentioning option letters).]
