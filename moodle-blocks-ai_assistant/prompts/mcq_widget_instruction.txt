Generate EXACTLY {QUESTION_COUNT} high-quality MCQs at {LEVEL} level on the following topic:

Subject: {SUBJECT}
Topic: {TOPIC}
Lesson: {LESSON}
Focus Area: {AGENT_TEXT}
Keywords: {TAGS}

CRITICAL: Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this EXACT format with no extra text:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Clear, concise question text without numbering",
      "options": [
        "Option A text",
        "Option B text",
        "Option C text",
        "Option D text"
      ],
      "Correct Answer": "A",
      "Explanation": "Detailed 3-5 sentence explanation of why the correct answer is right"
    }
  ]
}

QUALITY STANDARDS:

1. Difficulty Level Guidelines:
   - BASIC: Test fundamental concepts, definitions, and simple recall
   - INTERMEDIATE: Test application, analysis, and problem-solving skills
   - ADVANCED: Test synthesis, evaluation, and complex reasoning

2. Question Requirements:
   - Each question must be clear, unambiguous, and grammatically correct
   - Exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D) per question
   - Only ONE correct answer per question
   - Distractors (wrong options) must be plausible but NOT obviously incorrect
   - No "All of the above" or "None of the above" options
   - Avoid negative phrasing ("Which is NOT...") when possible

3. Explanation Requirements:
   - 3-5 sentences explaining the correct answer
   - Include relevant concepts, formulas, or reasoning
   - Do not show Option numbering/order in the explanation
   - Help the learner understand WHY the answer is correct

4. Content Requirements:
   - Questions must be relevant to {TARGET_EXAM} syllabus
   - Use proper scientific terminology and notation
   - Include chemical formulas, equations, or structures when appropriate
   - Ensure factual accuracy and up-to-date information

5. Formatting Rules:
   - NO markdown formatting in the JSON
   - NO question numbering (e.g., "Question 1:", "1.", etc.)
   - NO extra text before or after the JSON object
   - Use plain text for chemical subscripts (e.g., H₂O or H2O)
   - Keep explanations concise but informative

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the hybridization of the central carbon atom in methane (CH4)?",
      "options": [
        "sp hybridization",
        "sp2 hybridization",
        "sp3 hybridization",
        "sp3d hybridization"
      ],
      "Correct Answer": "C",
      "Explanation": "The carbon atom in methane undergoes sp3 hybridization, forming four equivalent hybrid orbitals. Each sp3 orbital forms a sigma bond with a hydrogen atom, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of 109.5 degrees."
